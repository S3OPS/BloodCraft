# **Chapter 15**

## The Academy Trials

The Academy of Magical Arts stood against the morning sky like a monument to centuries of accumulated power. Riven paused at the main gates, his pack slung over one shoulder, and tried to calm the nervous energy thrumming through his veins. The iron gates were wrought with symbols that shifted and changed as he watched—protection wards, he recognized, but far more sophisticated than anything he'd encountered before.

"First day nerves?" 

Riven turned to find a young woman with copper-red hair and eyes that flickered between green and gold. She wore the Academy's standard training uniform—dark trousers, a fitted tunic bearing the institution's crest, and a cloak that seemed to ripple with contained energy.

"That obvious?" Riven asked.

She laughed, extending a hand. "I'm Sera Nightwhisper. Third-year elemental. And yes, you have that wide-eyed look all the first-years get. Though..." She tilted her head, studying him with an intensity that made him uncomfortable. "You're different. Blood Archon, right? We don't get many of your kind here."

The way she said "your kind" wasn't overtly hostile, but it carried a weight that Riven was learning to recognize. He shook her hand carefully, aware of his own strength. "Riven Blackthorne."

"Oh, I know who you are." Sera's smile turned knowing. "Chancellor Corvinus doesn't personally evaluate students often. Word travels fast in these halls. Come on, I'll show you around before orientation. Consider it a welcome gift—and a warning."

She led him through the gates, and Riven felt the wards wash over him like cold water, assessing, cataloging, deciding whether to permit entry. For a moment, something in the magic pushed back against his blood magic, and he felt his power rise instinctively in defense.

"Easy," Sera said without looking back. "The wards react to power. Don't fight them. Let them read you."

Riven forced himself to relax, and the sensation passed. They walked through, and suddenly the full scope of the Academy revealed itself.

The main campus was a sprawling complex of interconnected buildings, each one a masterwork of magical architecture. Towers spiraled upward, defying conventional physics, their peaks wreathed in clouds that sparked with lightning. Courtyards opened like flowers between the structures, gardens where plants grew in impossible colors and formations. Bridges of pure crystallized magic connected buildings hundreds of feet above the ground, and through open windows, Riven could see classrooms where students practiced everything from elemental conjuration to intricate spellwork that made the air shimmer.

"Impressive, isn't it?" Sera said. "The Academy was founded four hundred years ago by the Council of Eight—one representative from each major magical lineage. Well, seven now. The Blood Archon seat has been empty for... how long has it been?"

"Seventy-three years," Riven said quietly.

"Right. Since the Purge." She said it matter-of-factly, but Riven caught the quick glance she gave him. "That tower there—" she pointed to a structure of black stone that seemed to drink in light rather than reflect it, "—that's where Corvinus teaches. Advanced blood magic and hemomancy theory. No one goes there except by invitation."

They walked through the main courtyard, and Riven became aware of the stares. Students clustered in groups, and conversations died as he passed. Some looks were curious, others calculating. A few were openly hostile.

"You're going to deal with that a lot," Sera said, her voice lower now. "Most students here have only heard stories about Blood Archons. Usually stories about the wars, the blood tyrants, the..." She trailed off awkwardly.

"The monsters," Riven finished.

"I wasn't going to say that."

"But others will." Riven had dealt with fear and suspicion his entire life. The Academy would be no different, except here, the people who feared him were also trained in how to kill him.

Sera stopped at a fountain where water flowed upward, defying gravity. "Listen, I'm going to give you some advice. The Academy has a hierarchy. The old families—pure bloodlines going back centuries—they run things. Witches like the Thornwickes, the elemental houses, the high fae descendants. Then you've got the rest of us, talented enough to get in but without the pedigree. And then..." She hesitated.

"Then there's me," Riven said. "Bottom of the ladder."

"Or off the ladder entirely," she admitted. "But that doesn't mean you can't earn respect. Power speaks loudly here. Show them what you can do, but..." She met his eyes seriously. "Don't show them too much. Blood magic scares people for a reason."

Before Riven could respond, a bell rang out across the campus—not a physical bell, but a pure note of magic that resonated in his bones.

"Orientation," Sera said. "Main hall. Good luck, Blackthorne. Something tells me you're going to need it."

---

The main hall was a cathedral-like space with a ceiling that displayed the night sky regardless of the actual time of day. Hundreds of students filled the benches, and Riven found himself directed to a section marked for first-years. He sat near the back, conscious of the empty seats around him.

Chancellor Corvinus stood at the front, his presence commanding immediate silence. "Welcome," he said, his voice carrying effortlessly through the space without magical amplification—though Riven suspected there was magic involved anyway. "To those returning, welcome back. To the first-years, welcome to your transformation."

Riven listened as Corvinus outlined the Academy's history, its purpose, and its expectations. The school trained the magical elite, preparing them to serve the realm as advisors, protectors, and scholars. Students would be pushed to their limits and beyond. Many would fail. Those who succeeded would join a legacy spanning centuries.

"Your power is raw material," Corvinus continued. "Here, we will forge it into something purposeful. You will learn control, discipline, and wisdom. You will learn when to use your abilities and—perhaps more importantly—when not to." His eyes swept the room and seemed to linger on Riven for just a moment. "This week, you will undergo placement trials. These will determine your class assignments and training paths. I expect excellence. Nothing less will be tolerated."

After the ceremony, students filed out, and Riven found himself swept along with the crowd toward the residential quarters. The dormitories were organized by year and specialization, and he discovered he'd been assigned to a single room in the first-year wing—unusual, according to the muttering around him. Most students shared quarters.

His room was spartanly furnished: a bed, a desk, a wardrobe, and a window that overlooked the training grounds. He unpacked quickly, then headed to the common area where first-years were gathering.

The atmosphere was charged with nervous energy and competitive posturing. Clusters had already formed—students from the same families or regions or species grouping together. Riven recognized the social dynamics immediately. He'd been an outsider his entire life.

"Blood Archon."

The voice was cold and aristocratic. Riven turned to face a tall young man with platinum blonde hair and the kind of perfect features that spoke of generations of magical breeding. His uniform was immaculate, and he wore it with the confidence of someone who'd never doubted his place in the world.

"Lucian Thornwicke," the young man introduced himself, though his tone suggested Riven should have already known. "Seventh generation witch, House Thornwicke. My family has trained at this Academy since its founding."

"Congratulations," Riven said neutrally.

Lucian's smile didn't reach his eyes. "I want to make something clear. The Academy may have lowered its standards enough to admit your kind, but that doesn't mean you belong here. Blood Archons are relics of a darker age. Your magic is corrupted, dangerous, and frankly, an insult to those of us with pure lineages."

Several students had gathered to watch the confrontation. Riven kept his expression calm, though his blood sang with the urge to respond. "I'm here on merit, same as you."

"Merit?" Lucian laughed. "You're here because Corvinus has some misguided notion about preserving dying bloodlines. Trust me, Blackthorne—you won't last the month."

"Lucian, leave him alone." A new voice cut through the tension. A young woman stepped forward—dark skin, natural hair styled close to her scalp, and eyes that crackled with barely contained lightning. "Save your posturing for the trials."

"Stay out of this, Kara," Lucian said dismissively.

"Or what? You'll throw another tantrum like you did last year when Master Blackwood told you your technique was sloppy?" Kara turned to Riven. "Kara Stormborn. Don't let the pure-blood snobs intimidate you. Half of them can barely light a candle without their family grimoires."

Lucian's face reddened. "You'll regret that."

"Add it to the list," Kara said cheerfully. She nodded to Riven. "See you at the trials."

As the crowd dispersed, Riven found himself alone again. But the encounter had confirmed what Sera had warned him about. The Academy might train magical elites, but it was also a battlefield of politics, prejudice, and power. And he was walking into it alone.

---

The placement trials began the next morning. First-years gathered in the main training arena—a vast circular space with walls carved with containment runes and a floor that could be reconfigured magically to simulate any terrain.

Master Blackwood stood at the center, arms crossed, expression stern. He was a bear of a man, scarred and grizzled, with the look of someone who'd spent decades in combat rather than behind a desk. "Combat assessment," he announced. "You'll face a series of challenges designed to test your reflexes, power control, and tactical thinking. Fail to defend yourself adequately, you'll be placed in remedial training. Excel, and you'll join advanced combat classes."

One by one, students stepped forward. Lucian went first, his magic precise and flashy—spectral weapons that he wielded with practiced ease. Impressive, but Riven noticed how much energy he burned for relatively simple effects.

Kara was next, and her elemental magic was raw and powerful. Lightning danced at her fingertips, and when she faced the conjured opponents Blackwood summoned, she fought with a combination of magic and physical prowess that drew approving nods from the instructor.

Then it was Riven's turn.

He stepped into the arena, and immediately felt every eye on him. The whispers started—Blood Archon, dangerous, watch what happens.

"Blackthorne," Master Blackwood said. "Show me what you can do."

Three constructs materialized—humanoid shapes made of solid magic, armed and aggressive. They attacked simultaneously.

Riven's blood magic responded instinctively. He didn't need incantations or gestures like the other students. His power was part of him, as natural as breathing. Blood drawn from a vial at his belt became a whip that lashed out, wrapping around one construct's neck. He pulled, and the construct shattered.

The second construct closed in. Riven shaped his blood magic into a blade, intercepting the creature's weapon. The clash sent sparks of crimson energy across the arena floor. He pivoted, using the construct's momentum against it, and drove his blood-blade through its chest.

The third construct was faster, more aggressive. It forced Riven to defend, to move, to think. He could feel his power wanting to surge, to overwhelm, to simply flood the arena with blood magic and crush everything in his path. But he remembered Corvinus's words. Control. Discipline.

He feinted left, then rolled right, coming up with his hand extended. Blood magic coalesced into a spear that he hurled with lethal precision. The construct exploded into fragments of dissipating energy.

Silence filled the arena.

Master Blackwood studied him with an unreadable expression. "Raw power, good instincts, but sloppy technique. You rely too much on brute force. In a real fight against a skilled opponent, that'll get you killed." He made a note on his tablet. "Advanced combat class. We'll work on refinement."

Riven returned to the sidelines, aware of the changed atmosphere. The stares now held more calculation, more respect—and more fear.

---

The afternoon brought academic assessments. In Master Thalia's chamber—a circular room filled with books that floated in slowly rotating orbits—the students were tested on magical history and theory.

Master Thalia herself was an ancient witch, her age impossible to determine, with silver hair that moved like it was underwater and eyes that had seen centuries pass. "Magic," she said, her voice like rustling parchment, "is not merely power. It is legacy, consequence, and responsibility. To wield magic without understanding its history is to walk blindfolded through a minefield."

She questioned each student, probing their knowledge. When she reached Riven, her expression softened slightly. "Mr. Blackthorne. Tell me about the Blood Wars."

It was a loaded question. The Blood Wars were the conflict that had led to the near-extinction of his people. "The Blood Wars began three centuries ago," Riven said carefully, "when Blood Archon houses sought to expand their territories. The conflict escalated into a campaign of conquest that threatened all other magical lineages. It ended with the Council's intervention and the Purge that followed."

"The official history," Master Thalia said. "Now tell me what really happened."

Riven hesitated. Every eye in the room was on him again. "The Blood Wars were more complex than simple conquest. Blood Archon society was fractured—some houses sought power, others sought survival. When the other lineages united against them, they didn't distinguish between the aggressors and the innocent. The Purge killed indiscriminately."

"And do you believe your people were victims?" Thalia's question was sharp.

"I believe," Riven said, "that both sides committed atrocities. But history is written by the victors."

Thalia's lips curved in something that might have been approval. "An honest answer. Remember, Mr. Blackthorne, that the truth is rarely simple and never comfortable. Advanced theory class. You'll need to understand the politics that shaped the world you're inheriting."

---

The final assessment was with Chancellor Corvinus himself, in his tower of black stone. Only a handful of students were summoned—those with particularly unique or powerful abilities.

Corvinus's study was lined with artifacts that pulsed with barely contained magic. Ancient texts bound in materials Riven couldn't identify. Vials of substances that seemed to shift between solid and liquid states. And everywhere, the scent of blood magic, old and powerful.

"Sit," Corvinus instructed.

Riven sat across from the Chancellor, who studied him with those ancient, knowing eyes. "Your combat assessment was impressive. Your academic understanding is adequate. But I want to test something more fundamental." He stood, moving to a shelf and retrieving a crystal orb filled with swirling red mist. "This is a blood resonance sphere. It responds to the depth and purity of blood magic. Most Blood Archons can activate a basic glow. The most powerful can ignite it fully."

He placed the orb on the desk between them. "Show me."

Riven extended his hand, not touching the sphere but letting his magic reach toward it. The connection was immediate and overwhelming. The orb blazed with crimson light, so bright Riven had to shield his eyes. But more than that—he could feel the resonance singing through his blood, connecting him to something vast and ancient.

"Enough," Corvinus said sharply, and Riven pulled back. The orb's light dimmed but didn't extinguish completely. The Chancellor's expression was a mixture of satisfaction and concern. "Your power is remarkable, Riven. Far beyond what I expected for your age and training. But power without control is a liability."

"I can control it," Riven insisted.

"Can you?" Corvinus leaned forward. "Your instincts in combat were to overwhelm, to dominate. That's the blood magic speaking—the legacy of those who came before you, warriors and conquerors who saw power as the ultimate answer. But you're here to learn a different path."

He stood, moving to the window that overlooked the Academy. "I brought you here not just to train your abilities, but to help you understand their weight. Blood Archons fell because they forgot that magic serves a purpose beyond personal gain. I won't let you make the same mistakes."

Riven felt the rebuke, but also something else—genuine concern. Corvinus wasn't just an instructor. In some strange way, he was trying to be what Riven had never had: a mentor.

"I'll work harder," Riven said.

"See that you do. Dismissed."

---

By the end of the week, Riven had settled into a routine. Morning combat training with Master Blackwood, where he learned to refine his instinctive fighting style into something more technical. Afternoons with Master Thalia, diving deep into magical history and the political forces that shaped the realm. Evenings with Corvinus, studying blood magic theory and learning to push his abilities in controlled, measured ways.

The other students remained distant, though the outright hostility had dulled somewhat. Lucian still made pointed comments about corrupted bloodlines, but Kara had taken to sitting near Riven during meals, their conversations brief but gradually warming into something like friendship.

On the seventh day, Riven found himself in the training grounds after hours, practicing the forms Master Blackwood had taught him. The grounds were supposed to be empty, but he sensed another presence.

"You're getting better." Sera materialized from the shadows, her elemental nature making her nearly invisible when she wanted to be. "I've been watching your progress. Impressive."

"Thanks," Riven said, lowering his practice blade. "What are you doing here?"

"Making sure you survived your first week." She smiled. "Not everyone does. Well, not literally—the Academy's safety protocols are extensive—but plenty of first-years wash out or transfer when they realize they're out of their depth."

"I'm not going anywhere," Riven said.

"I believe you." Sera's expression turned serious. "But here's something you should know. There's talk. Some of the upper-year students, particularly those from the old families, they're not happy about you being here. Lucian's family in particular has been... vocal."

"Let them talk."

"It's more than talk. The Academy has official rules, but it also has unofficial ones. Challenges, tests, ways for students to prove dominance without direct intervention from the faculty. You've made an impression, Riven. Some people will want to knock you down."

Riven thought about that. "And what do you suggest?"

"Keep doing what you're doing. Get stronger. Make allies where you can. And watch your back." She stepped back into the shadows. "See you around, Blackthorne."

---

That night, lying in his narrow bed and staring at the ceiling, Riven reflected on the week. He'd survived. More than that—he'd begun to prove himself. The instructors recognized his potential, even if they worried about his control. Some students were beginning to see him as more than just a dangerous relic.

But the challenges were only beginning. He could feel it—the weight of expectations, the burden of his bloodline, the knowledge that every action he took would be judged not just as an individual but as a representative of a nearly extinct race.

The Academy was more than a school. It was a crucible, and Riven would either be forged into something stronger or consumed by the fire.

He thought of Master Thalia's words about responsibility, Master Blackwood's lessons on discipline, and Corvinus's warning about the dangers of unchecked power. They were trying to teach him not just to survive, but to be worthy of the magic he carried.

Outside his window, the Academy's towers glowed with ambient magic, never truly dark. Somewhere in those halls, students plotted and studied and practiced, each one striving to become something more than they were.

Riven closed his eyes, feeling his blood magic pulse in rhythm with his heartbeat. He was a Blood Archon in a world that feared and hated his kind. But he was also a student at the greatest magical academy in the realm, with teachers who believed—or at least hoped—that he could be different.

The first week was complete. The real trials were just beginning.
