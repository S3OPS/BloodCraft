# **Chapter 7**

## Training in Shadows

The morning sun hadn't yet crested the mountains when Raechelle dragged Riven from bed. He stumbled onto the porch in yesterday's clothes, blinking sleep from his eyes, to find her already stretching in the pale pre-dawn light.

"Two weeks," she said, dropping into a fighting stance. "That's all we have before we need to leave for Nocturne. Before you meet Alexander and stand before the Council. Before everything changes."

Riven rubbed his face, trying to shake off the fog. "Two weeks to learn what exactly?"

"Everything." She straightened, and even in the dim light, her eyes gleamed with predatory focus. "How to sense blood. How to manipulate it. How to fight like a vampire instead of a human teenager. How to survive."

"That's... a lot."

"It's not enough." She gestured him closer. "But it's what we have. So we start now."

---

The first lesson was humbling.

Raechelle set a small glass bowl on the porch railing, filled it with blood from a medical bag she'd retrieved from her car—human blood, she explained, donated and stored properly. The dark liquid sat there, gleaming dully in the growing light.

"Feel it," she instructed, standing behind him. "Close your eyes. Blood magic isn't just in your veins—it's in your awareness. You need to sense the life force in the blood, the power it holds."

Riven closed his eyes, reaching out with... what? His mind? His instincts? He wasn't sure what he was supposed to be doing.

Nothing happened.

"I don't feel anything," he admitted after a long minute.

"You're trying too hard." Her voice was patient. "It's not about forcing it. The blood in that bowl—it came from a living person. It carried oxygen through their body, fought off infections, kept them alive. That energy doesn't just disappear. Feel for it."

He tried again. And again. And again.

By the time the sun fully rose, his head ached from concentration, and the blood in the bowl sat stubbornly inert.

"We'll try again tonight," Raechelle said, not unkindly. "When your vampire nature is stronger. For now, let's work on something you can actually do—fighting."

---

If the blood magic was frustrating, the combat training was brutal.

Raechelle moved like water, like wind, like nothing human had any right to move. She could be in front of him one second and behind him the next, sweeping his legs out from under him before he could blink.

"You're thinking like a human," she said, offering him a hand up for the dozenth time that morning. "Human reflexes, human speed. You're faster than that now. Stronger. But you have to stop limiting yourself."

"I'm trying," Riven gasped, already sweating despite the cool mountain air.

"Try harder." She came at him again.

They trained in the clearing behind the cabin, far from any trails or prying eyes. Raechelle taught him how vampires fought—dirty, efficient, exploiting every advantage of their enhanced nature. She showed him how to move with his new speed, how to strike with his new strength, how to use his senses to predict attacks before they landed.

He spent more time on his back than on his feet.

"Again," she said, and he groaned but got up.

---

**Day Three**

The blood in the bowl trembled.

It was past midnight, the cabin dark except for a single candle flickering between them. Riven sat cross-legged on the floor, eyes closed, reaching for that elusive sense Raechelle kept describing.

And then—there. A whisper of something. Like a pulse he could feel without touching, a warmth that called to something deep in his chest.

His eyes snapped open, and the blood rippled, just slightly.

"I felt it," he breathed.

Raechelle leaned forward, her expression intent. "Good. Now hold onto that feeling. Don't grab at it—guide it. The blood wants to respond to you. Let it."

He focused again, finding that thread of connection. The blood shifted, moving in lazy swirls that had nothing to do with the breeze.

"Excellent," Raechelle murmured. "Now make it move."

Riven concentrated, imagining the blood rising. It quivered, climbed maybe an inch up the side of the bowl, then splashed back down as his control slipped.

But it had moved.

"We'll build on this," Raechelle said, satisfaction warming her voice. "Every night, we practice. Push yourself, but don't burn out. Blood magic takes energy—your energy. Drain yourself too much, and you'll be useless."

That night, he dreamed of blood flowing through invisible veins, of power thrumming just beneath his skin, waiting to be claimed.

---

**Day Five**

"Your mother's journal mentioned blood sense," Raechelle said, guiding Riven through a morning meditation. "The ability to feel the life force in living creatures. It's one of the most useful skills a blood mage can have—knowing where your enemies are, how hurt they are, whether they're human or vampire."

They were sitting on the porch, the forest stretching out before them in shades of green and gold. Raechelle had cut her hand—just a shallow slice—and let a few drops fall onto the wooden boards.

"Feel the difference," she instructed. "Between the fresh blood and the stored blood from the bowl. One still hums with life. The other is fading."

Riven reached out with that new sense, the one that was slowly becoming more natural. The drops on the porch sang with a brightness the bowl blood lacked, vibrant and alive.

"I feel it," he said. "It's... warmer? Not in temperature, but in—"

"Energy," Raechelle finished. "Exactly. Now expand that sense. Feel for me."

He reached further, and there she was—a blazing presence of life force that dwarfed the blood drops. Not just her blood, but her entire being, strong and ancient and powerful.

"Whoa," he whispered.

"Now feel beyond me. Into the forest."

It took effort, concentration, but gradually he became aware of other presences. Smaller, dimmer—animals moving through the trees. Birds in the canopy. A deer picking its way through the underbrush a hundred yards away.

"This is incredible," Riven said, his eyes still closed.

"This is survival," Raechelle corrected. "In Nocturne, you need to know who's approaching before they're in striking distance. You need to know if that figure in the shadows is human, vampire, or something else entirely. Blood sense will keep you alive."

They practiced until his head throbbed and his nose began to bleed—a sign he'd pushed his new abilities too far.

"Enough," Raechelle said, pressing a cloth to his nose. "You're doing well, Riven. Better than I expected."

The praise warmed him more than it probably should have.

---

**Day Seven**

One week in, and Riven was starting to feel the change. Not just in his abilities, but in his body. He was faster, stronger, his reflexes sharpening with each passing day. The morning runs that left him gasping on day one now barely winded him. The combat drills that seemed impossible were becoming muscle memory.

He still couldn't beat Raechelle—not even close—but he was lasting longer. Making her work for it.

"Better," she said after a particularly intense sparring session, barely breathing hard while he bent double, gulping air. "You're starting to move like a vampire. Using your speed instead of fighting against it."

"Does that mean I get a break?" Riven managed.

She smiled, slow and dangerous. "No. It means we can push harder."

But despite her words, she led him back to the cabin and poured him a glass of water. They sat on the porch steps, shoulders touching, watching the sun climb higher.

"You know," Riven said, "when I found your letter in Mom's journal, when I drove out here... I didn't know what to expect. I definitely didn't expect this."

"This?"

He gestured vaguely. "Training montage. Rocky music should be playing."

Raechelle laughed, the sound surprised and genuine. "Your pop culture references are terrible."

"But accurate."

She shook her head, but she was smiling. Then her expression grew more serious. "Riven, I need you to understand something. The training we're doing here—it's accelerated. Normally, a fledgling would have months, even years, to develop these skills. We're compressing everything into two weeks."

"I know," he said quietly.

"When we get to Nocturne, you're going to be the least experienced vampire there. Some of them have been alive for centuries. They'll see you as a child playing at power."

"So we prove them wrong."

She turned to look at him, and something flickered in her eyes—pride, maybe, or hope. "Yes. We do."

On impulse, Riven leaned over and kissed her cheek. "Thank you. For all of this. For not giving up on me."

Raechelle's breath caught. For a moment, she seemed frozen, then she turned her head and kissed him properly, her lips cool and soft against his. It was brief, gentle, nothing like the passionate encounter in the cabin, but somehow it felt more meaningful.

When they pulled apart, she rested her forehead against his. "We should get back to training."

"Probably," he agreed, not moving.

They sat there for a few more minutes, just breathing, before discipline won out and Raechelle stood, offering him her hand.

"Come on, blood mage. Let's see if you can lift more than a few drops now."

---

**Day Ten**

The breakthrough came in the middle of the night.

Riven woke from a dream he couldn't quite remember, power humming under his skin. He climbed out of bed, padding quietly to the main room where Raechelle slept on the couch—she'd insisted, despite his protests.

She wasn't there.

He found her on the porch, staring out at the moonlit forest. She didn't turn when he approached, but he knew she'd heard him.

"Couldn't sleep?" he asked.

"Old habit. The night has always felt more comfortable."

Riven sat beside her, and for a while, they didn't speak. Then, on impulse, he held out his hand palm-up and focused. The blood magic came easier now, almost natural. A drop of his own blood beaded on his fingertip, and he pulled it free with his will, shaping it in the air.

It floated between them, a perfect sphere of deep crimson, catching the moonlight.

"Show off," Raechelle murmured, but she was smiling.

Riven shaped the drop into different forms—a spiral, a star, a small flower. It was delicate work, requiring fine control he didn't have ten days ago.

"I've been thinking about the ritual," he said as he worked. "The familiar bond. What exactly does it entail?"

Raechelle watched the blood flower spin slowly. "It's an exchange of blood and power. We drink from each other, and the magic binds us. You'll gain some of my strength, my experience. I'll gain... well, whatever you have to offer. It's intimate, Riven. More than the physical connection we've already shared. It's soul-deep."

"Are you sure you want that?" he asked quietly. "To be bound to me?"

She finally looked at him, and her eyes were ancient and certain. "I've never been more sure of anything. You're not just a job anymore, Riven. You haven't been for a while."

The blood flower trembled in the air between them.

"I'm scared," he admitted. "Of Nocturne. Of meeting Alexander. Of not being good enough."

"Good." She reached out and caught the blood drop, absorbing it back into her skin. "Fear keeps you sharp. But don't let it control you. You're stronger than you think. These past ten days have proven that."

Riven leaned his head on her shoulder, and she wrapped an arm around him. They sat like that until dawn, drawing strength from each other.

---

**Day Thirteen**

"Combat test," Raechelle announced. "You and me, full speed. I want to see everything you've learned."

They faced each other in the clearing, the afternoon sun casting long shadows through the trees. Riven settled into a fighting stance, feeling his blood hum with readiness.

Raechelle moved first, a blur of motion. But this time, Riven was ready. He used his blood sense to predict her trajectory, twisting away from her strike and countering with one of his own. She blocked easily, but had to actually block—he wasn't just a punching bag anymore.

They danced through the clearing, a lethal ballet of vampire speed and strength. Riven couldn't match her experience, but he was learning to use everything else—his blood magic to sense her movements, his new speed to stay ahead, the tricks she'd taught him to exploit openings.

He even landed a hit, his fist connecting with her shoulder, sending her back a step.

They both froze.

"Did I just—" Riven started.

Raechelle's grin was fierce and proud. "Yes, you did. Again."

They went another round, then another. By the end, Riven was exhausted but exhilarated. He'd lost every match, but he'd made her work for it. He'd landed strikes. He'd avoided her attacks.

He'd proven he could fight.

"Not bad," Raechelle said, barely winded. "Not bad at all. You'll still get your ass kicked by most of Nocturne's vampires, but at least you'll make them earn it."

"High praise," Riven said dryly, but he was grinning.

That night, he successfully levitated an entire cup of blood, holding it steady in the air for a full minute. When his control finally slipped and it splashed back into the container, Raechelle clapped slowly.

"Two weeks ago, you didn't even know blood magic was real. Now look at you."

Riven flexed his fingers, feeling the power settle back under his skin. "It's not enough, is it? What I can do. Compared to real blood mages."

"No," she said honestly. "But it's a start. And starts are important."

---

**Day Fourteen**

The last day arrived too quickly.

They spent the morning doing final drills—blood manipulation, combat, blood sense. Riven demonstrated everything he'd learned, and Raechelle corrected, advised, pushed him to be better.

By afternoon, it was time to pack.

Riven stood in the cabin's main room, looking around at the space that had been his haven and training ground for two weeks. His mother's journal sat on the table, full of notes he'd added in the margins. The medical bags of practice blood were nearly empty. The furniture bore evidence of his clumsiness—scuffs from when he'd crashed into things at vampire speed, a cracked chair leg from a particularly enthusiastic sparring match.

"Ready?" Raechelle asked from the doorway, her own bag already packed and waiting by the car.

"No," Riven admitted. "But I don't think I'll ever be ready, so we might as well go."

She crossed to him, taking his face in her hands. "Listen to me. When we get to Nocturne, when you meet Alexander and the Council, they're going to test you. Push you. Try to find your weaknesses."

"Sounds fun."

"Don't be cute. I need you to be smart." Her thumbs brushed his cheekbones. "You're a Blackwood and a Thorne. You're a fledgling blood mage with potential. You're my familiar—or you will be, after the ritual. Those things give you power, but they also make you a target."

"I know."

"Do you trust me?"

"Yes," he said without hesitation.

"Then trust that I'll keep you safe. And trust yourself—you've earned that much."

Riven pulled her into a kiss, pouring two weeks of growing feelings into it. When they broke apart, he rested his forehead against hers.

"Let's go face the music," he murmured.

---

They loaded the last of their things into Raechelle's car as the sun began its descent. Riven took one final look at the cabin—his mother's sanctuary, the place where he'd transformed from a confused human into something more.

"Thank you," he said softly to the empty building. To his mother's memory. To the past two weeks.

Then he climbed into the passenger seat, and Raechelle started the engine.

"Austin is about four hours away," she said, pulling onto the mountain road. "We'll arrive after dark, check into a hotel. Tomorrow night, we meet Alexander. The night after that, the bonding ritual."

"And then?"

"And then we see what Nocturne has in store for us." She reached over and squeezed his hand. "Together."

Riven squeezed back, feeling the blood magic pulse between them, the connection they'd built over two weeks of training, fighting, and growing closer. He wasn't ready for what was coming—not really.

But he was ready to try.

As they drove down the mountain, the cabin disappeared behind them, swallowed by trees and distance. Ahead lay Austin, Nocturne, Alexander, and a future Riven couldn't predict.

But for the first time since his mother's death, he wasn't facing it alone.

He was a blood mage now, trained and tested. A fledgling vampire with power thrumming under his skin. And soon, he would be bound to Raechelle Thorne, one of the most powerful vampires in Texas.

The Council could test him all they wanted.

He'd be ready.
