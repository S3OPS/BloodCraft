## ⚠️ COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

1. **Info-Dumping**: Don't explain everything at once
   - ✓ Weave details naturally through scenes
   - ✗ Paragraph-long explanations stopping action

2. **Repetitive Descriptions**: Don't reuse same details
   - ✓ Vary how you describe recurring elements
   - ✗ "Crimson blood magic flared" every single time

3. **Static Dialogue**: Don't just exchange information
   - ✓ Add physical actions, reactions, interruptions
   - ✗ "Character A said. Character B said. Character A said."

4. **Telling vs. Showing**: Don't summarize emotions
   - ✓ "His hands trembled, blood magic flickering"
   - ✗ "He was scared and tired"

5. **Pacing Monotony**: Don't maintain same speed throughout
   - ✓ Vary between intense and reflective
   - ✗ Constant high-action or constant slow description
