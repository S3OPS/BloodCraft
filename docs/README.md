## 📖 About Blood Craft

Blood Craft is a supernatural fantasy series that explores identity, power, and redemption through two distinct creative directions:

1. **Canonical Version**: Traditional hero's journey with clear heroes and villains
2. **Paradox Version**: Psychological thriller with Shutter Island-level twist

Both versions tell the story of Riven Sixxx, but with dramatically different implications and thematic depth.
