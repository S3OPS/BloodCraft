## 📖 About Blood Craft

2. **Paradox Version**: Psychological thriller with Shutter Island-level twist (fully written, 30 chapters, ~97,000 words) - **In [separate repository](https://github.com/S3OPS/BloodCraftParadox)**

Both versions tell the story of Riven Sixxx, but with dramatically different implications and thematic depth.
