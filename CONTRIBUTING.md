# Contributing to Blood Craft

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Blood Craft! This document outlines guidelines for developing both the **Canonical Version** and **Paradox Version** of the story.

---

## 📚 Repository Overview

Blood Craft maintains **two parallel storylines** with distinct creative directions:

1. **Canonical Version** (`canonical-version/`) - Traditional hero's journey
2. **Paradox Version** (`paradox-version/`) - Psychological thriller with major twist

Both versions share the same core characters and world but diverge in narrative approach and thematic depth.

---

## 🎯 Development Philosophy

### Parallel Development
- Both versions should be developed simultaneously to maintain parity in quality and scope
- Changes to world-building elements should be synchronized across both versions
- Character development may diverge based on each version's narrative needs

### Version Independence
- Each version stands alone as a complete narrative
- Readers should be able to enjoy either version without needing the other
- Creative decisions for one version don't dictate the other

---

## 📝 Development Guidelines

### Working on Both Versions

When making changes that affect both versions:

1. **World-Building Changes**
   - Update both `canonical-version/` and `paradox-version/` files
   - Maintain consistency in supernatural rules, locations, and lore
   - Document changes in both Chapter-Summary-and-Timeline.md files

2. **Character Development**
   - Ensure core character traits remain consistent
   - Allow for version-specific character growth
   - Update character arcs in both versions appropriately

3. **Timeline Consistency**
   - Major events should occur at similar story beats
   - Pacing should remain comparable between versions
   - Update both timeline documents when adding chapters

### Working on Individual Versions

When making version-specific changes:

1. **Canonical Version Focus**
   - Maintain clear hero's journey structure
   - Keep morality straightforward (clear heroes/villains)
   - Emphasize romantic fantasy and power progression
   - Ensure satisfying, uplifting resolutions

2. **Paradox Version Focus**
   - Maintain psychological complexity
   - Layer in subtle foreshadowing for the twist
   - Develop moral ambiguity and grey characters
   - Ensure the twist feels earned and emotionally resonant

## 📋 Chapter Development Checklist

When adding new chapters to either version:

### Pre-Writing
- [ ] Review Chapter-Summary-and-Timeline.md for context

### File Naming Conventions
- Use kebab-case for file names: `Chapter-Summary-and-Timeline.md`
- Main story files: `Blood-Craft-{Version}.md`
- Keep consistent naming across both versions

---

## 🔄 Version Synchronization

### Elements That Should Stay Synchronized
- **Supernatural Rules**: Blood magic mechanics, elemental abilities, Archon powers
- **World Geography**: Nocturne layout, locations, realms
- **Core Character Traits**: Riven's personality fundamentals, Raechelle's core nature
- **Timeline**: Major events should occur at comparable story points
- **Supporting Cast**: Secondary character personalities and roles

### Elements That Can Diverge
- **Character Arcs**: How characters grow and change
- **Relationship Dynamics**: Depth and nature of relationships
- **Plot Resolutions**: How conflicts are resolved
- **Thematic Focus**: Moral complexity vs. clear morality
- **Narrative Tone**: Psychological depth vs. straightforward adventure

---

**Key Elements**:
- Clear heroic progression (underdog to powerful leader)

**Avoid**:

- Ensure consent and communication are clear

### Action Scenes
- Keep pacing brisk
