## 🔄 Version Synchronization

### Elements That Can Diverge
- **Character Arcs**: How characters grow and change
- **Relationship Dynamics**: Depth and nature of relationships
- **Plot Resolutions**: How conflicts are resolved
- **Thematic Focus**: Moral complexity vs. clear morality
- **Narrative Tone**: Psychological depth vs. straightforward adventure
