## 🎯 Quick Summary

### The Critical Issue: Raechelle's Hair Color

**Canonical:** MIDNIGHT BLACK (7 instances)  
**Inconsistent:** Crimson (1x at line 4979), Amber/Copper (1x at line 5917)

**Fix Required:**
- Line 4979: Change "matched her hair" → "complemented her midnight hair"
- Line 5917: Change "amber hair...copper" → "midnight hair...dark silk"
- Line 5607: Review context (may need midnight instead of silver)

### Other Major Issues:
1. Duplicate content in chapters 19.5/20, 23.5/24, 30.5/31
2. Terravos age: "thousands of years" vs "three centuries"
