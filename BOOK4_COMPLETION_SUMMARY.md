## Notes

The chapters maintain the established tone and style while bringing the story to a satisfying conclusion. Key relationships are honored, sacrifices are meaningful, and the ending provides both closure and hope. Elena's potential Prime Archon abilities are revealed but not fully explored, leaving room for future stories if desired.

The beach vacation promise from earlier becomes a symbol of hope and normalcy earned through struggle. The epilogue emphasizes that legacy is about what we build together rather than individual heroics, tying together the series' themes beautifully.
