## 🚨 URGENT: Read This First

A reader reported: *"everything after chapter 16 is really confusing its like there is two story lines"*

**This report is 100% ACCURATE.**

The canonical Blood Craft file contains **duplicate chapters from two separate drafts** that were accidentally merged together. This creates:

- ❌ Impossible timelines (same events at different times)
- ❌ Repeated scenes with different details  
- ❌ Broken narrative flow
- ❌ Complete reader confusion

**The story MUST be fixed before any further work or publication.**

## 🎯 The Problem Explained (60 Seconds)

**What Happened**:
- Two separate drafts of the post-Chapter-16 story exist
- Both drafts were accidentally merged into the same file
- Result: Duplicate chapters at different positions

**Specific Duplications**:
1. **Chapters 19.5 & 20**: IDENTICAL "Bonds of Alliance" (word-for-word)
2. **Chapters 16 & 22**: BOTH describe archive discovery "morning after Ball" (impossible - weeks pass between them)

**Reader Experience**:
- Reads same scenes twice with slight variations
- Timeline makes no sense
- Battles seem to repeat
- Complete narrative confusion

**The Fix**:
- Delete duplicate chapters (19.5 and 22)
- Renumber remaining chapters
- Clean up timeline markers
- Result: Clean, readable story
