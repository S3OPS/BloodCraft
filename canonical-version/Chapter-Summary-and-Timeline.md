## Notes for Future Development

- Each chapter should balance action, politics, character development, and while revolving mainly romance
- The Dom/sub relationship should deepen organically, reflecting trust and intimacy
- Supernatural world-building should continue throughout without overwhelming the narrative
- Supporting characters should have their own arcs that intersect with the main story
- Maintain tension between Riven's desire for revenge and his growing responsibilities
- Romance scenes should serve character development, with ample titillation
