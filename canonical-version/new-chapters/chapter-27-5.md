# **Chapter 27.5**

## The Calm Between Storms

I woke to sunlight filtering through silk curtains—actual natural sunlight, not the perpetual twilight of Nocturne proper, but the warm golden rays that reached our private quarters through the enchanted skylight Raechelle had commissioned after the war ended. For the first time in months, I didn't immediately reach for the tactical reports on my nightstand. Instead, I simply lay there, savoring the sensation of peace.

Raechelle was curled against my side, her breathing deep and even. In sleep, she looked younger somehow—the centuries of burden and worry smoothed away, leaving only the beautiful woman I'd bound my soul to. Her midnight hair spilled across my chest in silken waves, and I couldn't resist running my fingers through it gently, careful not to wake her.

*I'm awake, Sir,* she sent through our bond, her mental voice warm with amusement. *I've been awake for ten minutes, just enjoying this.*

"Why didn't you say something?" I asked aloud, my voice rough with sleep.

She opened one violet eye. "Because you needed ten more minutes of thinking I was asleep. You were so tense when you first woke—cataloging threats, assessing dangers. Then you relaxed. Started petting me instead of planning." She shifted to prop herself up on one elbow, a teasing smile playing on her lips. "I approved of the change."

"Petting?" I raised an eyebrow. "I was stroking your hair."

"Semantics." She leaned down to kiss me, slow and deep, tasting of sleep and familiarity. When she pulled back, her eyes were soft. "First peaceful morning in months. How does it feel?"

"Strange," I admitted. "I keep waiting for an alarm, a summons, an emergency. Something that requires the Blood Archon to solve immediately."

"Well, the Blood Archon is currently off duty." She traced a finger down my chest, following old scars that even my enhanced healing hadn't completely erased. "Today, you're just Riven. My Riven. And we have no obligations, no meetings, no wars to fight."

"What about that Council review of the new territorial agreements?" I asked.

"Next week."

"And Viktor's pack celebration?"

"Tomorrow night." She pressed a finger to my lips. "Today is ours. Completely, totally ours. Lady Seraphina's orders, actually. She threatened to seal us in the house if we tried to attend anything official."

The image of the dignified Council leader barricading our door made me laugh. "She's getting bolder."

"She says you've aged her fifty years in the last six months, and she's had enough. So she's given us a mandatory day off." Raechelle slid out of bed, completely unselfconscious in her nudity. Centuries as a shapeshifter had erased any human modesty she might have once possessed. "I'm making breakfast. You're staying in bed for exactly fifteen more minutes. Then you're joining me in the kitchen, and we're cooking together like we used to."

"Used to?" I protested. "We've never—"

"Exactly my point." She pulled on one of my shirts—just one of my shirts, which fell to mid-thigh on her smaller frame—and the sight made something warm bloom in my chest. "We've been together for almost two years, fought a war, bound our souls for eternity, and I still haven't made you my famous blood pancakes."

"Blood pancakes?"

"Family recipe. Secret ingredient." She winked. "Come find out."

She disappeared toward the kitchen, leaving me alone in our bedroom. I took the opportunity to really look around, seeing it with fresh eyes now that we weren't constantly rushing between crises.

The room reflected both of us. My preference for modern minimalism blended with Raechelle's love of rich textures and warm colors. Books lined one wall—my computer science texts mixed with her ancient grimoires on blood magic. A weapons rack held my twin blood-forged blades next to the elegant rapier she favored in human form. And everywhere, small touches that marked this as ours: photographs from the Crimson Ball, pressed flowers from our bonding ritual, a ridiculous "World's Best Blood Archon" mug Viktor had given me as a joke.

We'd made a life here. Not just survived, but actually built something worth protecting.

*Riven Sixxx, if you're not in this kitchen in three minutes, I'm eating all the bacon,* Raechelle threatened through our bond.

I smiled and rolled out of bed, pulling on sleep pants and making my way through our home. The Sixxx ancestral house had been restored after the war—all the damage from Terravos's early attacks repaired, the wards stronger than ever. But we'd also made changes. Opened up walls to let in more light. Added cozy spaces designed for living, not just impressing visiting dignitaries. Turned my mother's formal parlor into a reading room with deep comfortable chairs and shelves groaning under the weight of books we'd actually read.

The kitchen smelled divine. Raechelle stood at the stove, her back to me, humming something that might have been an ancient Welsh folk song. Bacon sizzled in one pan while she whisked something red and slightly luminescent in a bowl.

"Blood pancakes are actually red," I observed, sliding my arms around her waist from behind.

"Made with crystallized dragon's blood extract," she confirmed, leaning back into me. "It's a superfood for vampires and blood mages. Helps regenerate magical reserves. My mother used to make them for me when I was learning to shift."

"Your mother." I pressed a kiss to the top of her head. "You never talk about your family."

"Long story. Centuries long." She poured batter onto a griddle, where it hissed and bubbled. "But yes, I had a family once. Before I was bound to the Sixxx bloodline, before I became a familiar. I was just Raechelle, youngest daughter of the Darkpurr clan, more interested in hunting than the political machinations that consumed my sisters."

"I want to hear it," I said. "Not now, if you're not ready. But someday. All of it."

She turned in my arms, her expression soft. "Someday," she agreed. "When we have long quiet nights and nothing but time. I'll tell you everything." She gestured to the bacon with a spatula. "For now, flip that before it burns."

We fell into an easy rhythm. I handled the bacon and eggs while she managed the pancakes. We moved around each other with the unconscious choreography of two people deeply in tune—her ducking under my arm to reach the spice cabinet, me shifting left to give her room at the griddle, our bodies aware of each other in a way that went beyond conscious thought.

"Open," Raechelle commanded, holding up a forkful of pancake.

I obeyed, letting her feed me. The taste exploded across my tongue—rich, sweet, with an underlying metallic tang that sang to my blood magic. Energy flooded through me, washing away the last vestiges of exhaustion.

"Okay, that's amazing," I admitted.

"Family secret." She looked incredibly smug. "Passed down through the Darkpurr clan for generations. And now I'm teaching it to you, which means you're practically family."

"We're soul-bonded," I pointed out. "I'm pretty sure that makes us family."

"Soul-bonding is one thing. Learning to make blood pancakes is another entirely. This is serious business." But she was grinning, radiant in the morning light.

We loaded up plates and took them to the breakfast nook—a small alcove with windows overlooking Nocturne's garden district. The view showed the city transformed. The damaged buildings from the war had been rebuilt. The streets that once ran with blood now bustled with supernatural citizens going about their lives. Vampires, werewolves, witches, and fae mingled freely, the shared trauma of war having broken down centuries-old barriers.

"We did that," Raechelle said softly, following my gaze. "Not just surviving the war, but building something better after it."

"We had help," I said. "Viktor, Morgana, Seraphina, Corvinus—"

"Yes, but they followed your lead. Your vision of what Nocturne could be." She squeezed my hand. "You're allowed to take credit occasionally, you know."

"It feels weird."

"You defeated an ancient Earth Archon, reorganized the Council, negotiated peace treaties with fourteen different supernatural factions, and personally saved Nocturne at least six times. But taking credit feels weird." She shook her head fondly. "You're ridiculous."

"You love me anyway."

"Desperately." She said it without hesitation, without games. Just pure truth flowing through our bond and her words.

We ate in comfortable silence, stealing bites from each other's plates and occasionally pausing to just look at each other—really look, without the pressure of impending battle or political maneuvering. It was intimate in a way that had nothing to do with physical touch and everything to do with simply being present.

"So," Raechelle said eventually, "what does Riven Sixxx do on a day off?"

"I have no idea," I admitted. "Before all this, I was a college student. My idea of a day off was video games and junk food."

"Well, you're a Blood Archon now. Probably can't spend the day on a gaming binge."

"Why not?" I challenged. "Pretty sure there's no rule that says Archons can't enjoy recreational activities."

Her eyes lit up. "Are you suggesting we waste our first day of peace in months playing video games?"

"I'm suggesting we do whatever sounds fun. And right now? Yeah, video games sound pretty damn good."

"I'm in," she declared immediately. "On one condition."

"Which is?"

"After gaming, we explore the city. The parts we never had time to see during the war. I want to take my Blood Archon on a proper date."

My heart did something complicated in my chest. "We've been bonded for two years and you've never mentioned dates before."

"Because we've been fighting for survival. Dates seemed frivolous compared to, you know, not dying." She laced her fingers through mine. "But now we have time. And I want to romance you properly. Court you the way I would have if we'd met under normal circumstances."

"Normal circumstances where you're a shapeshifting panther who's been alive for centuries and I'm a newly awakened Blood Archon?"

"Exactly those normal circumstances."

I laughed and pulled her into my lap, not caring that we were both still holding forks. "All right. Gaming, then a date. But I'm warning you—I'm very good at video games."

"And I'm a tactical genius with supernatural reflexes." She kissed my nose. "You're going down, Blood Archon."

"Promises, promises."

---

Three hours later, I was learning that Raechelle had not been exaggerating about her gaming skills. She'd massacred me in every fighting game I owned, then proceeded to destroy me at a cooperative RPG by constantly stealing all the good loot.

"This is supposed to be cooperative!" I protested as she ninja-looted another legendary weapon that would have been perfect for my character.

"It is cooperative. I'm cooperating with myself to get the best gear." She examined the digital sword on screen with satisfaction. "Besides, you're too slow. If you wanted it, you should have grabbed it faster."

"Centuries of supernatural reflexes are basically cheating."

"Centuries of supernatural reflexes are an advantage I'm choosing to use." She paused the game and turned to face me, straddling my lap on the couch. "Though if you want, I could think of other things to do with these reflexes..."

Her meaning was crystal clear in the heated look she gave me and the way her hips settled against mine. I gripped her waist, torn between continuing this playful banter and giving in to the desire that had been building all morning.

"Weren't we supposed to go explore the city?" I managed.

"The city will still be there in a few hours." She rolled her hips deliberately, making me groan. "Right now, I want to explore something else."

"Raechelle—" Whatever I'd been about to say died as she kissed me, deep and demanding.

The game controller clattered to the floor, forgotten. My hands slid under her borrowed shirt—my shirt—finding warm skin. She gasped into my mouth as my fingers traced patterns across her back, following the lines of old scars I'd long since memorized.

Through our bond, I felt her desire mirroring mine, amplified by the connection until it was impossible to tell where my need ended and hers began. This was what our bond had become—not just a tactical advantage in battle, but an intimacy so profound that pleasure doubled, shared between us in real-time.

*Bedroom,* she sent, her mental voice breathless. *Now.*

I didn't need to be told twice. I stood, her legs wrapping around my waist, and carried her through the house. We were laughing and kissing and utterly consumed by each other, stumbling into walls because neither of us wanted to break contact long enough to navigate properly.

We made it to the bedroom. Barely.

What followed was urgent and tender by turns. Two years together and we still found new ways to drive each other crazy, still discovered places that made the other gasp. The bond amplified everything—each touch, each kiss, each whispered endearment flowing between us until we were drowning in sensation.

"I love you," I breathed against her skin. "God, Raechelle, I love you."

"Show me," she challenged, her eyes dark with desire. "Show your familiar how much."

So I did.

---

Later—much later—we lay tangled together in sheets that had definitely seen better days, both of us thoroughly exhausted in the best possible way.

"So," Raechelle said, her finger tracing idle patterns on my chest, "still want to go explore the city?"

"Give me ten minutes to remember how my legs work."

She laughed, the sound vibrating against my side where she'd pressed close. "I suppose I did get a bit enthusiastic."

"A bit?" I turned to look at her. "You literally tried to—"

"Shh." She pressed a finger to my lips, grinning. "We don't speak of that. At least not until we can both walk properly."

I captured her finger in my mouth, making her shiver. Through the bond, I felt her considering round two, weighing it against actually getting out of the house.

"City," she decided firmly. "We're exploring the city. Because if we stay in this bed, we're never leaving, and I have plans."

"Plans?"

"So many plans." She slid out of bed, stretching with feline grace. "First stop: The Crimson Market. There's a vendor who sells enchanted jewelry, and I want to get you something."

"I don't really do jewelry," I protested.

"You will when you see what he makes. Trust me."

Twenty minutes later—after a shower that nearly derailed our plans again—we were dressed and heading into Nocturne proper. Raechelle had chosen a deep purple dress that made her eyes luminous, while I'd gone with dark jeans and a crimson shirt that she'd deemed "acceptable for a Blood Archon in casual mode."

The city was alive in a way I hadn't had time to appreciate during the war. The Grand Promenade bustled with activity—vendors calling out their wares, street performers entertaining crowds, supernatural citizens of every description going about their lives. And everywhere, signs of peace. Children playing without fear. Couples walking hand in hand. Laughter echoing off ancient buildings.

"It's different," I said as we walked, my hand finding Raechelle's automatically.

"It's better," she corrected. "This is what Nocturne was always supposed to be. What it was before Terravos's shadow fell across everything." She squeezed my hand. "What you helped restore."

The Crimson Market occupied a series of interconnected squares in Nocturne's mercantile district. Stalls and shops offered everything from basic supplies to powerful magical artifacts. The scent of exotic spices mixed with the metallic tang of blood magic and the earthy smell of werewolf leather goods.

Raechelle led me confidently through the maze, clearly familiar with the layout. We stopped at a small stall tucked into a corner, easy to miss if you didn't know where to look.

The vendor was an ancient gnome whose weathered face spoke of centuries. His eyes lit up when he saw Raechelle.

"Lady Darkpurr! I heard rumors you'd survived the war. Glad to see them true."

"Master Ironforge," she greeted him warmly. "I've brought someone special. My mate and bond-partner."

The gnome's eyebrows rose as he turned his attention to me. "The Blood Archon himself. Well, well. What can this humble jeweler offer one who defeated Terravos?"

"Raechelle said you make enchanted jewelry?" I said, feeling slightly out of my depth.

"Enchanted doesn't begin to cover it, young Archon." He pulled out a small box, opening it to reveal an array of rings, pendants, and bracelets that seemed to pulse with contained power. "Each piece is attuned to its wearer, growing stronger as they do. They can store magic, amplify existing abilities, or provide protection in combat."

"Show him the matching set," Raechelle urged. "The one we discussed before the war."

Master Ironforge's expression softened. "Ah, yes. I wondered if you'd ever come back for these."

He withdrew a different box, this one made of dark wood with silver inlay. Inside rested two rings—one masculine, one feminine, both crafted from what looked like solidified moonlight wound through with crimson threads.

"Bloodmoon silver," the gnome explained. "Incredibly rare. Can only be forged during a blood moon by a master craftsman. These two rings are linked—what one feels, the other echoes. They enhance the bond between mates, allow for deeper connection even across distances."

"We already have a bond," I pointed out, but I couldn't take my eyes off the rings.

"A familiar bond, yes. But these celebrate a different kind of connection. The choice to be partners, not just bonded souls." Raechelle picked up the smaller ring, examining it in the light. "I commissioned these a year ago. Before the final battle. I thought... if we survived, I wanted us to have something that symbolized us choosing each other. Every day."

My throat tightened. "Raechelle..."

"Not an engagement ring," she clarified quickly. "We're already bonded deeper than any marriage. But a promise ring. A symbol that even if the bond broke somehow, even if circumstances changed, I would still choose you."

I took the larger ring from the box, feeling the weight of it. Through our bond, I felt Raechelle's nervousness—her fear that maybe I'd think this was silly, that we didn't need symbols when we had something so much more profound.

"I love it," I said simply. "And I love that you thought of this. Yes. Absolutely yes."

Her smile could have powered Nocturne's lights for a week. She took the ring from my hand and slid it onto my right ring finger. It adjusted instantly, fitting perfectly, and I felt a subtle warmth spread through my hand as the enchantments activated.

I took her ring and mirrored the gesture, sliding it onto her finger while maintaining eye contact. "I choose you, Raechelle Darkpurr. Today, tomorrow, for as long as we exist. You're not just my familiar or my bond-mate. You're my partner in every way that matters."

"I choose you too, Riven Sixxx. My Blood Archon. My mate. My ridiculous, noble, frustrating, perfect partner."

We kissed there in the middle of the Crimson Market, completely unconcerned with the vendors and shoppers moving around us. Through the new rings and our bond, the connection deepened in ways I couldn't quite articulate—like finding a new frequency on a radio you'd been listening to for years.

Master Ironforge cleared his throat delicately. "I'm very happy for you both. That will be eight hundred sovereign crowns."

"Worth every coin," Raechelle said, and paid without hesitation.

---

We spent the afternoon exploring Nocturne like tourists in our own city. Raechelle showed me places she'd discovered over the centuries—a hidden garden where flowers bloomed in defiance of the eternal twilight, a bookshop that specialized in texts from dead civilizations, a café where the coffee was served by vampire baristas who took their craft very seriously.

"I never knew this existed," I said, standing in an art gallery that featured works by supernatural artists. The paintings ranged from traditional landscapes to abstract pieces that seemed to shift and move as you watched.

"Most people don't. It's by invitation only." Raechelle studied a portrait of what looked like a ancient vampire queen. "The artist is a friend. Or was. She died in the war."

The reminder that our peace had cost lives sobered the mood. I pulled Raechelle close, pressing a kiss to her temple.

"Tell me about her," I said.

"Eloise Nightshade. She was three hundred years old, looked twenty-five, and had a wicked sense of humor. She painted this series about the secret lives of supernatural beings—what we did when humans weren't watching." Raechelle gestured to the various paintings. "That one shows werewolves hosting a book club. That one is a vampire trying to assemble IKEA furniture. And that one..." She smiled through tears. "That one is a familiar teaching her Blood Archon to dance."

The painting showed a man and woman mid-waltz, the man clearly concentrating while the woman laughed. They were rendered in soft watercolors that captured movement and joy perfectly.

"She painted this after seeing us at the Crimson Ball," Raechelle whispered. "Two weeks before she died defending the eastern ward."

I didn't know what to say. The cost of our victory had been high—too high. Hundreds had died. Thousands more bore scars both physical and psychological. And here, in this quiet gallery, one of those losses became real in a way that casualty reports never could.

"She wanted you to have it," a voice said behind us.

We turned to find a young vampire—couldn't be more than fifty, practically a baby in vampire terms—approaching with cautious respect.

"I'm Dominic, Eloise's apprentice. She left instructions before the battle. If she didn't return, I was to give you this painting." He gestured to the familiar scene. "She said it captured something important. The moment a leader remembered to be human."

"I don't..." I started, then stopped. What could I say? Thank you felt inadequate.

"She believed in what you were building," Dominic continued. "A Nocturne where art mattered again, where we could create instead of just survive. She died making sure that future existed." He pressed a small card into my hand. "The painting is yours. Consider it her gift to the Blood Archon and his mate."

He left before we could respond. I stood there, holding the card with Eloise Nightshade's information and a delivery address, feeling the weight of every life spent in service of the peace we now enjoyed.

"We honor them by living well," Raechelle said softly. "By building the world they died to protect. By not wasting the peace they gave us."

"You're right," I said. "And we will. But right now, I think we should honor them by appreciating this art. Seeing what they created. Remembering them as more than casualties."

We spent an hour in that gallery, learning about Eloise and the dozen other artists who'd died during the war. Their works lived on—paintings and sculptures and installations that spoke to the supernatural experience in ways that transcended species and politics.

By the time we emerged, evening was falling. Nocturne's twilight deepened into full night, and the city transformed. Lights flickered on in windows. The eternal moon rose higher. And the energy shifted from daytime business to nighttime pleasure.

"Hungry?" Raechelle asked.

"Starving."

"Good. Because I made reservations."

She led me through winding streets to a part of Nocturne I'd never explored—an enclave where buildings leaned together like old friends sharing secrets. The restaurant occupied the ground floor of a converted mansion, its entrance marked only by a small silver plaque: "Moonlight Sonata."

Inside was elegant sophistication mixed with comfortable warmth. The décor blended modern minimalism with ancient supernatural artifacts. Soft music played—an actual piano in the corner where a vampire pianist coaxed beauty from the keys. And the clientele was diverse: vampires, werewolves, witches, even a few fae, all dining together.

"Lord Sixxx, Lady Darkpurr," the maître d' greeted us warmly. "Your table is ready."

He led us to a private alcove overlooking a interior garden where bioluminescent plants provided soft illumination. The table was set for two, crystal glasses catching the light.

"You planned this," I said as we settled into our seats.

"I might have made a few arrangements." Raechelle looked pleased with herself. "Figured we deserved one night that was special. Just for us."

A waiter appeared with menus and a wine list that featured labels I couldn't begin to pronounce. Raechelle ordered in flawless French, selecting wines and courses with the ease of someone who'd been dining at fine establishments for centuries.

"Should I be intimidated that you know what 'Château Margaux 1961' is?" I asked.

"Only if you want to be." She grinned. "Or you could trust your mate to order things you'll enjoy."

"I trust you."

The simple statement made her pause, her expression softening. "I know you do. And I still marvel at it sometimes—that you, who barely knew me a few years ago, trust me with everything."

"You've earned it," I said. "A thousand times over."

Our first course arrived—some kind of carpaccio with garnishes I didn't recognize but tasted incredible. We ate and talked about nothing important—her favorite books, my childhood gaming obsessions, the ridiculous bet Viktor had made about whether Morgana's newest apprentice would last a month (Raechelle said yes, I said no).

The food kept coming, each course more impressive than the last. Somewhere around the fourth course, I realized I couldn't remember the last time we'd done this. Just sat and enjoyed each other's company without the weight of war or politics or supernatural drama.

"What are you thinking?" Raechelle asked, catching my expression.

"That I want more of this," I admitted. "Not just today. But regularly. Building a life that includes dates and art galleries and ridiculously expensive dinners."

"And blood pancakes in the morning?"

"Especially blood pancakes in the morning." I reached across the table to take her hand, feeling the new ring solid and warm on my finger. "We've been so focused on surviving, on fighting, on fixing everything that's broken. But maybe it's time to focus on living."

"Living," she repeated, testing the word. "What does that look like for you?"

"Honestly? I don't know yet. But I want to figure it out. With you."

Her thumb traced circles on my palm. "You mentioned children. Last night, after the Council meeting. You brought up starting a family."

My heart rate kicked up. We'd danced around this topic for months—both knowing we wanted it eventually but never quite ready to make it real.

"I did," I confirmed. "And I meant it. But there's no rush. We have time now. No wars to fight, no enemies at the gates. We can take this at whatever pace feels right."

"What if the right pace is soon?" She met my eyes, vulnerability clear in her expression. "I've been alive for centuries, Riven. I've seen empires rise and fall. But I've never had a family of my own. And now, with you, it feels possible. More than possible—it feels right."

"You're sure?" I asked. "Because this is permanent. A child is forever."

"I'm sure." No hesitation. "I want to build this life with you. All of it. The quiet mornings and expensive dinners and yes, children. A family that we create together."

I came around the table, pulling her up to kiss her properly. Around us, other diners pretended not to notice, though I caught a few smiles and approving nods.

"Then let's do it," I said against her lips. "Not tonight necessarily, but soon. Let's start figuring out what kind of parents we want to be."

"Chaos," she predicted. "We're going to be chaotic parents."

"The best kind."

We finished dinner in a glowing haze of contentment and possibility. The future stretched ahead, full of promise instead of threat. And for the first time since my parents died, I felt ready for it.

---

Walking home through Nocturne's nighttime streets felt different now. Safer. The city hummed with life and magic, but it was controlled, orderly. No more emergency ward activations. No more running footsteps carrying news of attack. Just the normal rhythm of a supernatural city at peace.

"Viktor's pack celebration tomorrow," I remembered. "Should we bring something?"

"Whiskey and good humor," Raechelle said. "That's all werewolves really want."

"And Morgana invited us to her coven's autumn ritual next week."

"Which we're attending because it's politically important and also because her rituals are actually quite beautiful."

"And Seraphina wants us at the Council formal session to officially record the treaty with the eastern territories."

"Which will be boring but necessary."

We'd reached our front door. I paused before opening it, turning to face Raechelle in the moonlight.

"Is this what normal feels like?" I asked. "Social obligations and dinner dates and coming home together?"

"I think so." She cupped my face with both hands. "I think this is the life we fought for. Not perfect, not without complications, but ours."

"I'll take it."

Inside, we made tea and settled onto the couch with books—her with an ancient grimoire, me with a novel I'd been trying to finish for months. I rested my head in her lap while she read, her fingers absently stroking my hair.

The silence was comfortable. Complete.

"Riven?" she said eventually.

"Mm?"

"Thank you."

"For what?"

"For today. For every day. For choosing me."

I tilted my head to look up at her. "Always, Rae. Every single day, I choose you."

She leaned down to kiss me, the book sliding forgotten to the floor. And as we lost ourselves in each other again, I thought about the future—about children who would have her eyes and my stubbornness, about teaching them magic and history and how to be good people in a complicated world.

About building a family in this city we'd bled to protect.

About life, finally, after so much death.

The calm between storms, Seraphina had called it. But maybe it wasn't just a calm. Maybe it was the peace itself—hard-won, precious, and absolutely worth fighting for.

---

Much later, as we lay tangled together in bed once more, exhausted and content, Raechelle pressed close to my side.

"Sir?" she said, her voice drowsy.

"Hmm?"

"When we have children... I want them to know about everyone we lost. Eloise, and all the others. I want them to grow up understanding that peace isn't free."

"We'll tell them," I promised. "And we'll make sure they know that every day of peace is a gift. A responsibility to live well and honor those who can't."

"Good." She was quiet for a moment. "And I want blood pancakes to be a family tradition."

I laughed softly. "Blood pancakes are already the family tradition. I'm pretty sure our kids will demand them daily."

"Our kids." She said it with wonder, like testing out the words. "That's going to take some getting used to."

"We have time," I reminded her. "All the time in the world."

She fell asleep first, her breathing evening out. I lay awake a while longer, watching the moonlight through the skylight and thinking about everything that had brought us here. The tragedy, the war, the countless near-death experiences. But also the love, the loyalty, the moments of grace that had sustained us.

Tomorrow we'd attend Viktor's celebration. Next week, Morgana's ritual. The week after, Council sessions and diplomatic meetings and all the mundane business of running a supernatural city.

But tonight? Tonight was ours. The calm between storms. The peace we'd earned.

And it was beautiful.
