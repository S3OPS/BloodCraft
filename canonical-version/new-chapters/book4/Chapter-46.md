---

The research compound we'd established in the Archon Spire's subterranean levels buzzed with controlled chaos.

Five days. We'd been working for five days straight, barely sleeping, surviving on Morgana's stamina potions and sheer stubborn determination. The compound looked like a combination between a magical laboratory and a military command center—ritual circles drawn on every available floor space, tactical displays covering the walls, ancient texts piled on tables next to tablets running probability simulations.

And in the center, suspended in a containment field powerful enough to hold a small dragon, hung the captured Devourer fragment that Elena's team had been studying.

"The pattern frequencies are consistent," Morgana announced, reviewing data from the latest test. Her normally perfect appearance had given way to exhausted pragmatism—hair pulled back in a messy bun, robes stained with various magical reagents. "We've confirmed seventeen vulnerable nodes in the Devourer's structural matrix. If we hit them simultaneously with concentrated disruptive energy—"

"The cascade effect should cause catastrophic coherence failure," Corvinus finished, looking up from the ancient vampire texts he'd been cross-referencing. "In theory."

"Theory being the operative word," Lady Seraphina observed from her position near the tactical displays. To her credit, once the Council had unified behind the research effort, she'd thrown herself into it with surprising dedication. "We're basing this entire plan on patterns observed in a fragment the size of a basketball. The Devourer's core essence is exponentially larger."

"Which is why we need to test the theory on something bigger before attempting the final assault," Zephyra said, entering the compound with Viktor close behind. "And as of ten minutes ago, we have that opportunity."

The room went silent.

"The early warning network detected a new manifestation," Viktor reported grimly. "Reality tear opening in the abandoned western territories—the confluence point we evacuated last week. It's growing fast. At current expansion rate, it'll reach critical mass in approximately six hours."

"The Devourer's testing us," I said, immediately seeing the pattern. "Seeing if we'll respond to a threat in territory we've already written off. If we ignore it, the tear becomes permanent and gives it another anchor point. If we engage—"

"It learns how we plan to fight," Zephyra finished. "Observes our tactics, adapts its defenses, and comes back stronger when it launches the main assault."

"Catch-22," Morgana muttered. "Damned if we do, damned if we don't."

I studied the tactical display showing the new tear's location. Western territories, far from any remaining population centers. The Devourer had chosen well—isolated enough that we could engage without risking civilians, but significant enough that leaving it unsealed would create genuine strategic problems.

"We engage," I decided. "But carefully. Limited force, minimal exposure of our actual strategy. We can't let this tear become permanent, but we also can't reveal Elena's pattern-disruption technique until the final assault."

"How do you fight something without showing your actual capabilities?" Elena asked from her workstation where she'd been refining the mathematical models. "Any magic we use will teach it something."

"Then we use old magic," Raechelle suggested, appearing at my shoulder with the silent grace that still occasionally startled me. "Techniques it's already seen. Nothing new, nothing revealing. Just enough to seal the breach without exposing our true strategy."

"That's risky," Corvinus warned. "We barely held off the last assault using those methods. If the Devourer has adapted since then—"

"Then we adapt faster," I interrupted. "Raechelle's right. We respond with known techniques, seal the breach, and use the engagement to gather more data about its current capabilities. Test whether our five days of research have actually improved our tactical position."

"And who's 'we' in this scenario?" Viktor asked pointedly. "You're still recovering from reality-unmaking injuries. Zephyra's been channeling power non-stop for research purposes. Neither of you should be engaging in active combat."

"Which is why I'm going," Elena said calmly, as if volunteering for cosmic horror combat was a normal Tuesday activity.

"Absolutely not," I replied immediately.

"Dad, think strategically." Elena stood, moving to the tactical display. "Zephyra's right that you can't reveal your full Prime Archon capabilities before the final assault. But I can use standard Blood Archon techniques—four-affinity workings that the Devourer has already seen from other Archons. I've been training with Zephyra for five days. I know the sealing methods. And more importantly, I can observe the entity's structure up close, verify our pattern analysis with direct observation."

"She makes a valid point," Morgana said reluctantly. "We need field data to confirm the laboratory observations. Elena has the training and the capability. And sending her instead of you preserves the tactical surprise of your full power for when it matters most."

I wanted to refuse. Every paternal instinct screamed at me to keep Elena as far from the Devourer as possible. But the strategic part of my brain—the part that had led armies and coordinated defenses—knew she was right.

"She doesn't go alone," Raechelle said firmly, her tone making it clear this wasn't negotiable. "I accompany her. Plus a full tactical team—Viktor's best werewolves, Morgana's most experienced combat witches, and at least three senior Blood Archons."

"Plus me," Lucian spoke up from where he'd been working with Elena. "If Elena's going, her team goes. We've been studying the patterns together. We know what to look for."

"And me," Sara added, with Marcus—the fourth member of their study group—nodding agreement.

"This is turning into a full military expedition," Lady Seraphina observed dryly. "Rather undermines the 'limited engagement' concept."

"The alternative is sending Elena with insufficient support," I said, already knowing I'd lost this argument the moment Elena volunteered. "If we're doing this, we do it properly. Full tactical team, overwhelming force at the ready if needed, and multiple extraction options if things go wrong."

"Things always go wrong," Viktor muttered, but he was already moving to coordinate his werewolf contingent. "I'll have my best fighters ready to deploy in thirty minutes."

---

Two hours later, I stood in the Archon Spire's main hall, watching the tactical team prepare for deployment. Elena had swapped her research clothes for combat gear—reinforced leather designed to channel magic while providing protection, blood-red accents marking her as a Blood Archon.

She looked competent. Professional. Ready.

She also looked fifteen years old, and I was sending her to fight an entity that unmade reality.

"She'll be fine," Raechelle said quietly, appearing beside me. She was armored as well, twin daggers strapped to her thighs, her vampire-familiar aura crackling with barely contained power. "I'll keep her safe."

"I know you will." I caught her hand, squeezing gently. "But that doesn't make watching her walk into danger any easier."

"Welcome to every parent's nightmare," Raechelle replied with a slight smile. "At least you trained her well. She's not going in unprepared."

The team assembled—fifteen experienced fighters total, with Elena's young Blood Archon group at the tactical center. Viktor briefed them on extraction protocols while Morgana distributed protective charms. Zephyra walked Elena through the sealing technique one final time, her ancient face showing rare approval at my daughter's quick mastery.

"You have two objectives," I told the assembled team, projecting my voice with blood magic so everyone heard clearly. "Primary objective: Seal the reality tear before it reaches critical mass. Secondary objective: Observe and document the Devourer's current capabilities for research purposes. But—" I paused, making eye contact with each team member. "If anything goes wrong, if the situation deteriorates, you extract immediately. No heroics. No unnecessary risks. We need you alive more than we need this breach sealed. Understood?"

"Understood," they chorused.

"Elena." I moved to stand directly in front of my daughter. "You're field commander for the research observations. Viktor has tactical command of the combat elements, but pattern analysis is your responsibility. Trust your training. Trust your team. And if Raechelle tells you to fall back—"

"I fall back immediately," Elena finished. "I know, Dad. You've told me approximately seventeen times in the past hour."

"Humor me. It's my first time sending my daughter into combat against cosmic horror. I'm entitled to be paranoid."

Elena's expression softened. "I'll be careful. I promise."

She hugged me—quick and fierce—then stepped back and took her position with the team. Raechelle kissed me quickly, whispered "Trust us" against my lips, and joined the formation.

The blood-gate opened with a pulse of crimson power, and they were gone.

---

"You're going to wear a hole in the floor," Zephyra observed an hour later, watching me pace the command center where we were monitoring the team's progress.

"Constructive criticism noted," I replied, not stopping. The tactical displays showed the team's positions relative to the reality tear—currently approaching from multiple angles, establishing a containment perimeter before attempting the seal.

"She's more capable than you give her credit for," Zephyra continued. "In many ways, she reminds me of Marcus at that age. Brilliant, intuitive, fearless to the point of stupidity."

"That last part isn't reassuring."

"Wasn't meant to be. But Marcus lived to be one of the most powerful Prime Archons in history, so perhaps fearless stupidity has its benefits."

I was about to respond when the tactical display flared with sudden activity. The reality tear had expanded—not gradually but explosively, doubling in size in seconds. And the void-energy readings were spiking far beyond expected parameters.

"That's not normal growth," Morgana said sharply, moving to examine the data. "That's deliberate expansion. The Devourer is actively feeding power into this breach."

"It's a trap," I realized with cold certainty. "It wasn't testing us—it was baiting us. Luring a team out where it could isolate and destroy them."

I was reaching for my own blood-gate, preparing to reinforce the team, when Corvinus's hand stopped me.

"Wait," he said, ancient eyes fixed on the tactical display. "Look at the team's formation. They've already adapted."

He was right. Viktor's werewolves had shifted from containment positions to defensive perimeter, creating a barrier between the research team and the expanding tear. Morgana's witches were layering protective wards, buying time for Elena's group to work.

And Elena—my brilliant, fearless daughter—was standing directly in front of the breach, power blazing around her, observing the entity's structure even as tendrils whipped toward her position.

"She's gathering data," Zephyra said with something like pride. "Using the Devourer's aggression as an opportunity to observe its patterns under combat stress. That's... remarkably clever, actually."

"That's remarkably *insane*," I corrected, watching tendrils come within feet of Elena's position before Viktor's wolves intercepted them. "She's going to give me a heart attack before I'm forty."

"Better get used to it," Morgana said absently, still focused on the data streaming back from Elena's observations. "Because whatever she's recording is extraordinary. Look at those pattern frequencies—the variations we observed in the laboratory fragment are consistent at full scale, but there are additional harmonic structures we hadn't detected. If we can map those—"

"She needs to extract," I interrupted. "Now. The tear is still expanding, and those tendrils are getting more aggressive."

As if hearing me, Raechelle's voice came through the communication crystal. "Team leader to command. We've gathered sufficient data. Attempting breach seal now."

"Negative," I replied immediately. "That breach is too large for standard sealing techniques. Extract and fall back. We'll deal with it using Prime Archon power once you're clear."

"Dad—" Elena's voice cut in, frustrated. "We can seal this. Viktor's holding the perimeter, Morgana's wards are stable, and I've identified the optimal insertion points for the sealing working. Give us ten minutes."

"You don't have ten minutes," Zephyra said, her tone urgent. She was staring at a different tactical display, one showing void-energy readings across multiple locations. "The Devourer is opening secondary breaches. Three more tears manifesting—one near the Spire, one at the Academy, one in the southern territories. All growing rapidly."

My blood ran cold. "It's not isolating the team. It's dividing our response capability. If we extract the team now, we have to deal with this primary breach plus three new ones. If we leave them to seal it alone—"

"We risk losing them if something goes wrong," Corvinus finished grimly. "Difficult choice."

The same impossible calculations that had defined last week's disaster. Which threats to address, which positions to hold, which risks were acceptable.

"Command to team leader," I said into the crystal, making the call. "Proceed with breach seal. You have fifteen minutes maximum. If you can't seal it by then, extract regardless of progress. Understood?"

"Understood," Raechelle replied, and I felt her approval and concern through our bond in equal measure.

"Zephyra, you and I take the Spire breach," I ordered, already moving. "Corvinus, coordinate response to the Academy tear—pull whatever defenders are available. Morgana—"

"Southern territories," she anticipated. "I'll take my coven. We may not seal it completely, but we can contain it until you're available."

We scattered to our assigned positions, the carefully planned limited engagement having devolved into exactly the kind of multi-front crisis we'd hoped to avoid.

The Devourer was learning. Adapting. Turning our caution against us.

---

The Spire breach was smaller than the western territories tear but growing fast. Tendrils lashed at the building's wards, probing for weaknesses with disturbing intelligence.

"It knows we're here," Zephyra observed as we took positions on the Spire's peak. "Look at how the tendrils orient toward us specifically. It recognizes Prime Archon energy signatures."

"Good," I said, channeling power. "Let's give it something to recognize."

We worked in perfect synchronization—five days of research and preparation had refined our coordination to levels that would have seemed impossible back when we first met. My blood, fire, water, earth, and air affinities manifested simultaneously, weaving together with Zephyra's power into a working that sealed reality tears from the outside in.

Not the suicide technique. Not the pattern-disruption method we were saving for the final assault. Just the basic Prime Archon sealing that we'd practiced until it became second nature.

The breach resisted. The Devourer poured power into maintaining it, fighting our working with void-energy that made my teeth ache. But we were stronger, more experienced, and highly motivated.

The tear collapsed after eight minutes of sustained effort.

"Status on other breaches?" I called out, pulling my phone as soon as the sealing was complete.

Corvinus reported in first. "Academy tear sealed. No casualties. Whatever the Devourer is trying, it's not committing enough power to any single breach to overwhelm prepared defenders."

"Southern territories holding," Morgana added. "Breach is contained but not sealed. I need another twenty minutes for complete closure."

"Team leader reporting," Raechelle's voice came through, steady despite the strain I heard underneath. "Western breach is... fighting back. The Devourer is actively contesting the seal. We're making progress but it's slower than anticipated."

"How much longer?" I asked, checking the elapsed time. Thirteen minutes since I'd given them fifteen.

"Five more minutes," Elena's voice cut in. "Maybe less. The pattern analysis is helping—I know exactly where to apply pressure to collapse the structure efficiently. But Dad, you need to see this data. The harmonics I'm detecting, the way the Devourer's power flows through specific nodes—"

"Later," I interrupted. "Finish the seal first, scientific observation second."

"But—"

"Elena." I let command authority color my tone. "Seal. The. Breach."

"...Yes sir."

I coordinated with Zephyra, preparing to open a blood-gate to the western territories in case reinforcement became necessary. Watched the clock tick down—fourteen minutes, fifteen, sixteen.

"Breach sealed," Raechelle finally reported at the seventeen-minute mark. "Team is intact. No casualties. Extracting now."

The relief nearly staggered me. "Confirmed. Get everyone back to the Spire for debriefing."

"Riven," Elena's voice came through, excited despite obvious exhaustion. "The data I recorded—it changes everything. The pattern disruption plan? It's going to work. I'm certain now. I saw the structural vulnerabilities under active stress conditions, and they're even more pronounced than laboratory observations suggested. If we hit those nodes with the right frequency and timing—"

"Then we end this," I finished, feeling hope surge. "Good work. All of you. Now get back here so we can analyze what you found."

---

The debriefing lasted four hours.

Elena's field observations filled in gaps in our laboratory research, confirming that the pattern-disruption technique was viable at full scale. More than viable—potentially decisive. The crystalline structure of the Devourer's void-energy had consistent vulnerabilities across all manifestations, regardless of breach size.

"Seventeen nodes," Lucian explained, walking us through the mathematical analysis. "If we hit all seventeen simultaneously with disruption frequencies tuned to these specific harmonics—" he pointed to data from Elena's field recordings "—the cascade failure should propagate through the Devourer's entire structure within seconds."

"Should," Lady Seraphina noted. "Still theoretical."

"Less theoretical than six hours ago," Morgana countered. "Elena confirmed the vulnerabilities exist under combat conditions. We have the frequency specifications. We know the optimal timing for synchronized strikes. All we need now is enough power to hit all seventeen nodes simultaneously."

"Which brings us back to the fundamental problem," Corvinus said. "We have exactly two Prime Archons. Seventeen nodes requires seventeen simultaneous strikes. Even with you and Riven working together, Zephyra, you can't cover that many targets at once."

"We don't have to," Elena said. "Not if we amplify the working through multiple casters."

She brought up a new diagram—something she'd apparently been developing while I wasn't looking. "Prime Archons provide the power. But regular Blood Archons can act as channels, directing that power to specific target nodes. If we establish a network—Dad and Zephyra at the center, surrounded by experienced Blood Archons positioned at each of the seventeen nodes—"

"We could theoretically distribute Prime Archon power across all the vulnerable points simultaneously," Zephyra finished, her ancient eyes sharpening with interest. "Using the other Archons as conduits. That might actually work."

"Might," Viktor emphasized. "What happens to the Archons channeling that much power? Prime Archon energy isn't exactly gentle on normal magical systems."

"The calculations suggest it's survivable," Lucian said, though his tone was less confident than his words. "As long as the exposure is brief—under ten seconds—and the Archons have sufficient power reserves to handle the strain. But it would be... uncomfortable."

"Uncomfortable meaning potentially fatal," Raechelle translated. "You're asking seventeen Blood Archons to channel power that could kill them if anything goes wrong with the timing."

"Seventeen volunteers," Elena corrected. "Who would be saving the world from an existential threat. That seems like acceptable risk."

"You're fifteen," I said flatly. "You don't get to decide what qualifies as acceptable risk."

"I'm a Blood Archon," Elena shot back. "Same as everyone else who'd volunteer. And yes, before you ask, I'm volunteering. I know the pattern frequencies better than anyone else. I observed the nodes under field conditions. I should be one of the seventeen channeling positions."

"Absolutely not—"

"Riven," Zephyra interrupted, her tone commanding attention. "Put aside the parental concern for a moment and think strategically. Elena's right. She has the most direct observational data. She's been studying these patterns longer than anyone except Morgana. If we're asking seventeen Archons to risk their lives channeling power that could unmake them, don't we owe it to them to include the person best qualified to make the technique succeed?"

I wanted to argue. Wanted to pull rank, assert parental authority, refuse to let my daughter volunteer for something that could kill her.

But I'd made this argument before. Last week, when I'd left Elena to defend the Spire while I sealed the Academy breach. And she'd proven herself capable beyond my expectations.

"If Elena volunteers," Raechelle said quietly, "then I volunteer to be another of the seventeen channels. Someone has to keep her safe, and I'm not trusting that to anyone else."

"That's even worse," I protested. "Both of you risking—"

"Riven." Raechelle's hand found mine, gripping firmly. "You and Zephyra will be channeling the core power, putting yourselves at the center of void-energy exposure. Did you really think Elena and I would stand aside while you risk your life? This is a family effort. We all contribute, or none of us do."

I looked around the room at the assembled supernatural leaders. Viktor, watching with knowing sympathy. Corvinus, ancient and wise, nodding approval. Morgana, calculating but supportive. Lady Seraphina, surprisingly quiet for once. And Elena's young Blood Archon teammates, all looking ready to volunteer despite the risks.

This was what we'd built. Not an army where one leader made all the decisions and absorbed all the danger. A community where people shared both risk and responsibility.

"Fine," I said, the word feeling like surrender and acceptance simultaneously. "Elena and Raechelle volunteer for channeling positions. We need fifteen more experienced Blood Archons willing to risk exposure to Prime Archon power. Volunteers only—no conscription, no pressure. Everyone gets full briefing on the risks before committing."

"I'll volunteer," Corvinus said immediately. "Three thousand years old, plenty of power reserves, and frankly, I've lived long enough that risking my life for a good cause sounds more appealing than retirement."

"Count my people in," Viktor added. "Not for channeling—werewolves don't have the right magical structure. But for perimeter defense, extraction protocols, and anything else needed. We've got your backs."

"My coven as well," Morgana agreed. "And I suspect I can find at least ten experienced Blood Archons who'll volunteer once they understand what's at stake."

Over the next hour, we identified our seventeen channels. Elena's three classmates volunteered, despite being younger than ideal. Five senior Blood Archons from Corvinus's extensive network. Three more from Morgana's contacts. Two from surprisingly from Lady Seraphina's faction—apparently even she had people willing to risk everything for the greater good.

With Corvinus, Elena, and Raechelle, that made fourteen. We needed three more.

"I'll channel," I said, already anticipating Zephyra's objection. "I can split my attention—provide core power while also directing one of the seventeen disruption strikes."

"That's not possible," Zephyra said flatly. "The power requirements alone—"

"Are what they are. I'm a Prime Archon. If I can't handle channeling power through myself while simultaneously providing that power, I haven't been training hard enough." I met her ancient gaze steadily. "We need seventeen channels, and we're three short. I won't ask someone else to take risks I'm not willing to accept myself."

"Your martyrdom complex is showing again," Raechelle observed dryly.

"Not martyrdom. Strategy. If this works, the Devourer dies and we all survive. If it fails, we were probably dead anyway. Might as well commit fully to the plan most likely to succeed."

"I'll take a channel position," Lady Seraphina said, surprising everyone. "I may not be your greatest supporter, Riven, but even I can see this threat transcends political maneuvering. If you need seventeen Archons, count me as sixteen."

"And I'll be seventeen," a new voice said from the doorway.

We all turned to find Marcus—not Elena's classmate, but an ancient Blood Archon I'd met once at a Council function—standing there. He was perhaps two thousand years old, powerfully built, with the kind of quiet competence that came from surviving multiple civilization collapses.

"I heard you needed volunteers," he said simply. "For what it's worth, I believe in what you're trying to do here. Count me in."

Seventeen channels. We had our team.

"Then we have two days to train the technique and coordinate the final assault," I said, feeling the weight of command settle more heavily. "Zephyra and I will work with each channel individually, calibrating power flows and timing. Morgana, I need probability calculations on success rates given the parameters we've established. Viktor, coordinate with the tactical teams—we'll need perimeter defense during the final working. Corvinus, compile every piece of information we have about the Devourer's likely response patterns."

"And me?" Elena asked.

"You," I said, "are going to sleep. Minimum eight hours. You've been running on stimulants and stubbornness for five days, and you need actual rest before we attempt this. That's non-negotiable."

For once, Elena didn't argue. Probably because she was too exhausted to mount effective resistance.

The team dispersed to their assignments. I stayed behind in the command center, staring at tactical displays showing our territories, our forces, our desperate gambit of a plan.

"You know there's a significant chance this kills all seventeen channels," Zephyra said quietly, appearing at my shoulder. "Even with perfect execution, we're asking people to channel power that could unmake them. Some of them might not survive."

"I know," I said. "But it's the best chance we have. Better than the suicide technique. Better than trying to defend against endless assaults. This plan could actually end it."

"Or kill everyone we care about in the attempt."

"Yes." I didn't look away from the displays. "Welcome to command. Every decision risks lives. The trick is making sure those risks serve purposes worth dying for."

"Your daughter is braver than I gave her credit for," Zephyra observed. "Volunteering without hesitation, despite knowing the dangers. She reminds me of Marcus in his youth. All brilliant innovation and fearless determination."

"Please tell me Marcus survived to old age despite those qualities."

"He died at three thousand saving his apprentice from a reality-consuming entity remarkably similar to the Devourer," Zephyra said dryly. "So perhaps that comparison isn't as comforting as intended."

"Fantastic. That makes me feel so much better about letting my fifteen-year-old daughter volunteer for cosmic horror combat."

"You didn't let her. She chose it herself. There's a difference." Zephyra paused, then added more gently, "She's more capable than you fear and less invincible than she believes. The combination will either make her a legend or kill her young. Your job as a parent is accepting you can't control which outcome occurs."

"That's terrible parenting advice."

"I'm three thousand years old and never had children. You were expecting quality parenting advice?"

Despite everything, I almost smiled. "Fair point."

We stood in silence for a moment, watching tactical displays show the territories we were trying to save, the people depending on us to protect them from threats they couldn't see coming.

"Two days," I said finally. "We train, we prepare, and then we end this. One way or another."

"One way or another," Zephyra agreed. "Let's hope it's the way where we all survive."

---

I found Raechelle in our quarters, methodically cleaning and sharpening her daggers—the ritual she always performed before major battles.

"Elena's asleep," she said without looking up. "Finally. I practically had to drag her to bed, but she's down for the count."

"Good." I sat beside her, watching the familiar motions of her hands. "Are you angry with me?"

"For what? Trying to protect Elena? Accepting her volunteer status? Planning a technique that could kill her?" Raechelle set down one dagger, picked up the second. "I'm not angry. I'm terrified. But anger would require believing you had better options, and I don't think you do."

"We could refuse her volunteer status. Keep her out of the final working."

"And teach her that being young means being excluded from meaningful contribution? That family protects rather than trusts?" Raechelle shook her head. "No. Elena earned her place in this fight. She discovered the pattern vulnerabilities. She led the field research team. She proved herself capable repeatedly. Refusing her now would be insulting."

"But—"

"But she's our daughter and we want to wrap her in protective wards until she's a hundred years old," Raechelle interrupted. "I know. I feel the same way. But Riven..." She finally looked at me, eyes gleaming crimson in the low light. "We raised her to be strong. To be capable. To stand up for what matters. We don't get to take that back just because it's scary."

"I hate that you're right."

"You usually do." She set aside her second dagger, turning to face me fully. "So instead of arguing about whether Elena should participate, let's focus on making sure all seventeen channels survive the attempt. What do we need to do to minimize the risk?"

We spent the next two hours planning exactly that—calculating power flows, designing fallback protocols, identifying warning signs that would trigger immediate shutdown. If we were asking people to risk their lives, the least we could do was minimize that risk as much as possible.

"It's still dangerous," I said finally, reviewing our revised calculations. "Even with all the safeguards, there's maybe a twenty percent chance of casualties among the channels."

"Twenty percent is better than certainty," Raechelle replied. "And significantly better than the alternative of letting the Devourer win. We work with the options we have."

She was right. Again. As usual.

"I love you," I said, the words inadequate for everything I felt. "If this goes wrong—"

"It won't," she interrupted firmly. "We won't let it. Too many people are counting on us, and I refuse to disappoint Elena by letting her father die in cosmic horror combat. So we make this work."

"Just like that?"

"Just like that." She kissed me, fierce and certain. "Now come to bed. We have two days of intensive training ahead, and you need rest as much as Elena does."

I followed her to bed, feeling the familiar bond between us anchor me more securely than any magic. Tomorrow we'd begin training seventeen Blood Archons to channel power that could unmake them. Tomorrow we'd refine a desperate plan into something resembling actual strategy.

But tonight, I'd sleep beside the woman I loved, in a world I was determined to save.

Two days until everything changed.

Two days to prepare for our final stand against an entity that consumed reality itself.

Two days to prove that sometimes, desperate measures were exactly what victory required.
