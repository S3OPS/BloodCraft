# Chapter 42: The Council's Choice

**Word Count**: ~7,200 words  
**POV**: Riven Sixxx  
**Timeline**: Two days after Chapter 41's Devourer attack

---

The Council chamber had never felt so oppressive.

I stood before the assembled supernatural leadership—vampires, werewolves, witches, fae, and my fellow Blood Archons—and felt the weight of their stares like physical pressure. The emergency session I'd called had brought them here within hours, curiosity and concern warring on their faces. They knew something major had happened; you don't summon the entire Grand Council for trivial matters.

What they didn't know yet was that everything they thought they understood about me—about the balance of power in our world—was about to shatter.

Raechelle stood to my right, silent support radiating through our bond. To my left, Zephyra waited with the patience of three millennia, her presence already causing whispers among the Council members who didn't recognize her. Lady Seraphina Darkthorne watched from her seat with calculated interest, her expression revealing nothing. Viktor sat among the werewolf delegation, his face carefully neutral, while Corvinus occupied the vampire section with ancient eyes that had seen too much to be surprised by anything.

Or so he thought.

"Members of the Grand Council," I began, my voice steady despite the anxiety churning in my gut. "Two days ago, a threat emerged that poses an existential risk to our entire world. Not just the supernatural community—all of reality itself."

That got their attention. The murmurs intensified, spreading through the chamber like ripples in a pond.

"I've called this emergency session because you deserve to know the truth. About the threat. About how it emerged. And..." I paused, feeling Marcus's ring hot on my finger as I prepared to cross a threshold I could never return from. "About what I really am."

Lady Seraphina leaned forward, eyes sharp. "What you 'really are,' Riven? You're a Blood Archon who serves as our Balance. What else could there be?"

I met her gaze directly. "I'm a Prime Archon. A being capable of wielding all five elemental affinities simultaneously. There have been only three in recorded supernatural history, and their existence nearly tore our world apart."

The chamber erupted.

Shouts of disbelief, anger, fear—voices overlapping in a cacophony of reaction. Several Council members were on their feet, power crackling around them as instinct overrode reason. The werewolf alpha beside Viktor actually shifted halfway, claws extending before Viktor grabbed his shoulder and forced him back down.

"SILENCE!"

The voice came from Corvinus, amplified by centuries of commanding presence. The chamber stilled, though the tension didn't dissipate.

"Let him explain," the ancient vampire said calmly. "Before you decide whether to try killing him—which would be foolish, by the way—hear what he has to say."

I nodded gratitude at him and continued. "Five years ago, when I defeated Terravos, many of you assumed my power came from exceptional Blood Archon abilities. You weren't entirely wrong—but the truth is more complicated." 

I held up my hand, letting my suppression falter. Multiple affinities manifested simultaneously—crimson blood magic, golden fire, silver-white air, deep blue water, and brown-green earth—all swirling together in impossible harmony. The demonstration lasted only seconds, but the chamber stayed silent as I pulled the power back.

"My ancestor, Marcus, was also a Prime Archon. He lived three thousand years ago and his existence nearly sparked a supernatural civil war. When he died, he passed his genetic legacy to his descendants, dormant until it awakened in me on the night my parents were murdered."

"You've been lying to us for five years," Lady Seraphina's voice was ice. "Sitting on this Council, claiming to be our Balance, while hiding power that makes you essentially a god among us. How is that not a betrayal of everything we've built?"

"Because I used that power to build the peace we have," I shot back. "Not to conquer. Not to dominate. I hid my nature specifically to avoid the kind of fear and paranoia that's on your faces right now."

"Fear?" A fae lord I didn't know well stood, his ethereal features twisted with anger. "You speak of fear as if it's irrational. A Prime Archon could overthrow any faction, destroy entire territories, reshape our world according to his whims. Of course we fear that power."

"Then you'll be terrified of what comes next," Zephyra interjected, stepping forward. "Because I am also a Prime Archon. The second one, to be precise. And the fact that both of us exist in the same reality has awakened something that will kill us all if we don't act."

---

The next hour was brutal.

I explained everything—Zephyra's three-thousand-year stasis, the ancient Sanctums, the Devourer's nature as a reality-correcting force, the attack on my estate, the impossible choice we faced. Zephyra provided historical context, showing them records from the old Sanctum, explaining how Prime Archons functioned as catalysts for magical evolution but also created paradoxes the universe couldn't tolerate.

"You expect us to believe," Lady Seraphina said slowly, "that an entity called 'the Devourer' will consume all of reality because two Prime Archons exist simultaneously? That sounds less like supernatural threat and more like cosmic punishment for your very existence."

"That's exactly what it is," I agreed. "The universe maintains balance. Prime Archons destabilize that balance. When Marcus died, balance was restored. When Zephyra entered stasis, balance was restored. But now, with both of us active..." I gestured to the void-touched sections visible through the chamber's windows—reality tears that had opened during our meeting, drawn by our combined presence. "The Devourer awakens to eliminate the imbalance."

"By killing everyone?" A witch representative's voice shook. "We're collateral damage in the universe's attempt to murder you?"

"Yes," Zephyra said bluntly. "Which is why we need to act quickly. The Devourer will manifest in increasingly powerful attacks until it either consumes us or we find a way to destroy it."

"Or one of you dies," the fae lord pointed out. "That would restore balance, wouldn't it? One Prime Archon, no paradox, no Devourer. Problem solved."

The temperature in the chamber dropped ten degrees as Raechelle's power flared. "If you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting—"

"I'm suggesting," the fae lord continued, seemingly oblivious to imminent danger, "that sacrificing one person to save reality is a reasonable trade. Either of them could choose to end this. Instead, they're asking us to risk everything on a fight that might be unwinnable."

"Because asking someone to die isn't a solution," Viktor's voice cut through the tension. "It's cowardice disguised as pragmatism. Riven has spent five years serving this Council, maintaining the peace we all enjoy. The moment that becomes inconvenient, you want him dead?"

"Not what I want," the fae lord defended. "Simply what logic dictates."

"Logic dictates we fight," Morgana spoke up from the witch section. She'd arrived during the explanation, carrying more research materials. "I've spent two days reviewing every text I could find on reality-consuming entities. They're rare, but not unprecedented. And in every case where they were successfully defeated, it required exactly what we have—multiple sources of overwhelming power working in coordination."

"Or it required the paradox being eliminated," Lady Seraphina countered. "Which brings us back to the question of whether Riven's life is worth more than all of reality."

"My life isn't the issue," I said quietly. "If dying would truly solve this, I'd have done it already. But Zephyra explained the timeline—even if I died right now, the Devourer wouldn't simply vanish. It's already awakened, already manifesting. Killing the catalyst doesn't unmake what's been set in motion. All it does is remove one of the only powers capable of fighting back."

"He's right," Corvinus confirmed. "I've been researching as well, calling in favors from vampires old enough to remember the last reality disturbance five thousand years ago. Once entities like the Devourer manifest, they exist independent of their triggering cause. They have to be confronted directly."

The debate raged on. Factions formed and reformed as Council members argued, politicked, and maneuvered. Some stood firmly with me—Viktor's werewolves, Morgana's witch faction, Corvinus's vampire clan, and surprisingly, several Blood Archon families who saw me as one of their own despite the revelation. Others demanded I be stripped of my Council position, monitored, or even imprisoned "for the safety of all."

Lady Seraphina remained strategically neutral, her calculating gaze moving between factions as she assessed which side would benefit her most.

"Enough." My voice cut through the chaos, power rippling through my words without conscious thought. The chamber silenced. "I didn't call this session to debate my right to exist. I called it because the Devourer is coming, and we need to coordinate our defense. You can spend your time trying to kill me, or you can help me kill the thing that's actually trying to unmake reality. Your choice."

"That sounds like a threat," someone muttered.

"It's not a threat. It's a statement of priority." I looked around the chamber, meeting as many eyes as I could. "In the next few days, reality tears will begin appearing across all our territories. People will die if we're not prepared. The Devourer doesn't care about your politics or your fear of me—it will consume everything equally."

"Then what do you propose?" Lady Seraphina asked, her tone suggesting she already had her own answer but wanted to hear mine first.

"Coordination. Viktor's already organizing his packs as an early warning network—I propose extending that to all factions. When tears appear, we need rapid response teams capable of evacuation and containment. Morgana is researching potential weaknesses in the Devourer's manifestations—I need other magical experts contributing to that effort. And Zephyra will be training me in advanced Prime Archon techniques we'll need for the final confrontation."

"You speak as if this is already decided," the fae lord objected. "As if we have no say in whether we support this plan or find alternatives."

"What alternative?" I challenged. "Please, enlighten me. What's your solution that doesn't involve either hopeless sacrifice or coordinated defense?"

He had no answer. Few of them did.

The vote came an hour later, after more argument, more politicking, more fear dressed as caution. It wasn't unanimous—several factions abstained, others voted against the coordination plan, preferring to handle their own territories independently. But a slim majority agreed to work together.

It was better than nothing. Barely.

---

I found Elena in our estate's rebuilt east wing, practicing defensive wards with an intensity that spoke of frustration rather than training. Her power flared erratically, crimson energy sputtering as concentration failed.

"The Academy knows," she said without preamble when she sensed me. "About you. About what you are. Someone on the Council leaked it—probably deliberately."

My stomach clenched. "What happened?"

"At first, nothing. Then the whispers started. By lunchtime, half my class was staring at me like I'd grown a second head. The other half wouldn't look at me at all." She turned, and I saw the pain in her eyes—so much like Raechelle's, burning with hurt and anger. "Professor Ashford pulled me aside, asked if I was 'compromised' by proximity to a Prime Archon. As if living with my father somehow made me dangerous."

"Elena—"

"They're afraid of us now," she continued, power swirling around her in agitated patterns. "Not just cautious or concerned. Actually afraid. Some of the older students are organizing petitions to have me removed from advanced combat training. They say it's unfair, that I might have inherited your abilities and therefore have an unnatural advantage."

"And have you?" I asked gently. "Inherited multiple affinities?"

"I don't know!" The admission burst out of her, raw and frustrated. "I've only ever manifested blood magic, but after watching you fight the Devourer, after feeling your power... sometimes I wonder if there's more inside me, locked away. And if there is, does that make me what they think? A threat waiting to explode?"

I crossed the room and pulled her into a hug, feeling her resistance melt after a moment. She was so strong, my daughter. Fifteen years old and already facing prejudice and fear that would break most adults.

"You're not a threat," I said firmly. "You're Elena Sixxx-Darkpurr, a brilliant young Blood Archon who's worked incredibly hard to earn her place at the Academy. Whether you have one affinity or five doesn't change that. And anyone who can't see it is too blinded by fear to deserve your concern."

"Easy to say," she muttered into my shoulder. "Harder to believe when your friends suddenly find excuses not to study with you, when teachers eye you like you might detonate at any moment, when even the other Blood Archon students distance themselves because associating with you is political suicide."

Gods, I wanted to fix this for her. To storm into that Academy and force them to see her as she was—talented, dedicated, courageous. But I couldn't. This was her battle to fight, and all I could do was support her through it.

"Do you want to leave the Academy?" I asked. "We could arrange private tutoring, training here at the estate with Raechelle and me—"

"And prove them right?" Elena pulled back, eyes fierce. "Let them win by running away? No. I'm staying. I'm finishing my training. And when I graduate top of my class despite all of them, they'll have to acknowledge that I earned it fairly."

Pride surged through me, tinged with worry. She had Raechelle's determination and apparently my stubborn refusal to let fear dictate choices. It was going to either make her incredibly strong or get her hurt.

Probably both.

"Then you have our full support," I said. "But Elena? If it becomes too much, if you need a break or if things escalate beyond prejudice—"

"I'll tell you," she promised. "I'm not trying to be a martyr, Dad. I just... I refuse to be defined by fear. Theirs or mine."

A distant crack echoed across the estate grounds—reality tearing again. We'd had three small breaches since the Council meeting, each one sealed quickly but serving as reminders that our time was running out.

"You should get back to training," Elena said, already turning back to her own practice. "I'm fine here. Zephyra's waiting in the southern training ground, right?"

"How did you—"

"I can feel her presence. It's like..." Elena frowned, searching for words. "Like standing near a star. So much power it distorts everything around it. You feel the same way, actually, when you're not suppressing." She glanced at my hand, at Marcus's ring that still sat there even though its purpose had been exposed. "Are you going to keep wearing that?"

I looked down at the simple black band. For five years, it had been my shield, my disguise, my protection against the fear we were now facing regardless. Part of me wanted to tear it off, to embrace what I was fully and openly. But another part—the part that remembered the Council's reaction, Elena's treatment at the Academy, the way even allies now looked at me with wariness—wondered if hiding had been wise after all.

"I don't know," I admitted. "The secret's out, but the ring still serves a function. When I'm not actively using all five affinities, it helps maintain the illusion of normalcy. Makes people less... twitchy."

"So you'll keep hiding. Just partially instead of completely."

"I'll keep being strategic about when and how I show my full power," I corrected. "There's a difference between hiding in shame and choosing your battles carefully."

Elena considered that, then nodded slowly. "I guess that makes sense. Though I still think you should stop apologizing for what you are."

"I'm not apologizing. I'm surviving. There's a difference."

She smiled slightly. "Sounds like something Mom would say."

"Your mother is usually right about these things."

---

Zephyra was indeed waiting in the southern training ground, an area we'd specifically reinforced with multi-layered wards after the Devourer attack. She stood at the center of a complex ritual circle, power humming around her in waves that made the air shimmer like heat haze.

"You're brooding," she observed without turning. "The Council session went poorly, I assume?"

"About as well as expected," I said, joining her in the circle. "Half of them want me dead or imprisoned, the other half are too terrified to commit either way, and Lady Seraphina is playing political games while reality burns around us."

"Councils are always like that. Self-interest masquerading as public service, fear disguised as caution." She turned to face me, ancient eyes assessing. "But they agreed to coordinate defense efforts?"

"Barely. We have a slim majority and about a hundred grudging commitments that'll last until the moment something goes wrong, at which point everyone will blame me and scatter."

"So we make sure nothing goes wrong." Zephyra gestured to the ritual circle. "Which brings us to today's training. You've spent five years using multiple affinities separately—blood for combat, fire for passion-fueled attacks, water for healing, earth for defense, air for speed. That's amateur hour, Riven. It's time you learned what a Prime Archon can actually do."

"Which is?"

"Weave reality itself."

She demonstrated, her power manifesting in all five colors simultaneously—but not as separate streams. Instead, they braided together in impossible patterns, creating something that was more than the sum of its parts. The air around her shifted, thickened, became almost solid before dispersing back to normal.

"Affinities aren't just elements," Zephyra explained. "They're fundamental aspects of reality. Blood represents life and connection. Fire embodies transformation and passion. Water flows as adaptation and healing. Earth grounds and stabilizes. Air moves and changes. A Prime Archon doesn't just command these elements—we manipulate the concepts they represent."

She raised her hand, and I watched in fascination as reality itself seemed to bend around her fingers. Not a spell, not a technique I recognized, but raw manipulation of the fabric of existence.

"That's what we'll need to fight the Devourer," she continued. "Not individual affinities thrown at it, but reality manipulation at a fundamental level. We have to be able to reinforce existence itself, seal tears not just from the outside but from within the structure of reality."

"That sounds..." I struggled for words. "Impossible. Dangerous. Insane."

"All three," she agreed cheerfully. "But also necessary. So let's begin."

The training that followed made every combat lesson, every magical exercise I'd ever endured feel like child's play. Zephyra pushed me to places I didn't know my power could reach, forced me to understand magic not as separate disciplines but as interconnected aspects of a greater whole.

"Don't just manipulate blood—understand what blood represents," she instructed as I struggled to weave multiple affinities together. "It's life force, yes, but also connection between beings, the literal thread that binds families. Fire isn't just heat and destruction—it's transformation, the catalyst that turns one state into another. Use the concepts, not just the power."

Hours passed. My reserves depleted and regenerated as I pushed beyond limits I'd thought absolute. Multiple times, I felt reality start to warp around me in ways that triggered every survival instinct—that sense of wrongness, of fundamental rules being bent past their breaking point. Each time, Zephyra guided me back, showing me how to manipulate without destroying, to reshape without shattering.

"Better," she said as I successfully wove all five affinities into a coherent construct that reinforced rather than replaced local reality. "You're beginning to understand. The Devourer unmakes existence—we have to counter that by strengthening existence, pouring so much structured reality into the universe that it can't be consumed."

"That still sounds impossible," I gasped, exhausted beyond anything I'd felt before. This wasn't physical tiredness—it was spiritual, a bone-deep weariness that came from wrestling with forces too large for mortal comprehension.

"It probably is," Zephyra admitted. "But impossible is just another word for 'hasn't been done yet.' And we're going to do it, because the alternative is everyone we care about ceasing to exist."

A shimmer in the air caught my attention—Raechelle, approaching through the wards with careful steps. She'd stayed away from the training ground, respecting the dangerous work being done, but her presence through our bond had been a constant comfort.

"You need to see this," she said, her face carefully controlled but worry bleeding through. "Another tear opened in the city—Council Square, right in front of the Hall. It's large. Growing. And it's not responding to conventional sealing attempts."

Zephyra and I exchanged glances. This was it—the escalation we'd been dreading.

"How large?" I asked, already moving toward the estate's main gate.

"Twenty feet across and expanding. Viktor's forces have evacuated the immediate area, but if it keeps growing..." Raechelle didn't finish the thought. She didn't have to.

"Show me," Zephyra commanded, her power already swirling in preparation.

We teleported—a technique Zephyra had taught me during our training, using air affinity to fold space itself—and arrived in Council Square to chaos.

The tear dominated the plaza, a wound in reality that hurt to look at. Dark tendrils poured through, reaching toward fleeing civilians and the defensive lines Viktor's werewolves had established. But these tendrils were different from the ones that had attacked my estate—thicker, more purposeful, almost intelligent in their movements.

"It's adapting," Zephyra observed grimly. "Learning from our previous encounters. The Devourer isn't just a force of nature—it has intelligence. Malevolent, alien intelligence, but intelligence nonetheless."

"How do we seal it?" I was already channeling power, preparing to replicate the techniques that had worked before.

"We don't," she said, surprising me. "Not yet. First, we observe. This is a test, Riven—the Devourer is probing our defenses, seeing how we respond. We need to understand its tactics before we commit fully."

"People are dying!"

"And more will die if we exhaust ourselves on a feint while the real attack comes later." Her voice was hard, ancient experience overriding compassion. "This is war, Riven. Sometimes you have to let battles be lost to win the war."

I hated that she was right. Hated the tactical calculation that weighed lives against strategic advantage. But I also understood it—understood that rushing in without thinking was exactly what the Devourer wanted.

"Hold the perimeter," I called to Viktor, who nodded acknowledgment. "Evacuate anyone in range. Zephyra and I are going to study this thing before we engage."

We circled the tear, observing its behavior while carefully avoiding the tendrils. The Devourer's intelligence became more apparent as we watched—it wasn't just randomly attacking but targeting specific structures, specific people. Council members who'd been in the emergency session. Blood Archons from families that had supported me. Deliberate choices suggesting awareness and malice.

"It knows who we are," I said slowly. "What we care about. It's not trying to unmake reality randomly—it's trying to break us first."

"Psychological warfare," Zephyra agreed. "Smart. If it can make you act rashly, make you overextend trying to save everyone, you'll be vulnerable when the real assault comes."

"So what's our play?"

"We seal it. But carefully, methodically, learning as we go. This is our chance to understand how it operates before the stakes get higher."

Together, we approached the tear. The training paid off immediately—I could see things now that would have been invisible before, understanding the tear not just as a wound but as a structural weakness in reality's fabric. The Devourer wasn't just breaking through; it was exploiting existing weak points, places where the barriers between realities were naturally thinner.

"It's targeting confluence points," I realized. "Places where multiple ley lines intersect, where magical energy concentrates. That's why Council Square—there are seven major ley lines running beneath this plaza."

"Exactly," Zephyra confirmed. "Which means we can predict its next attacks. Any major confluence point in your territories is vulnerable."

We began the sealing process, working in tandem. Zephyra's three thousand years of experience complemented my raw power and genetic memory from Marcus. Together, we wove reality back together, reinforcing weak points and creating barriers that even the Devourer couldn't easily breach.

It fought us. The tendrils lashed out, trying to disrupt our concentration, to break the patterns we were weaving. But this time, I understood what I was doing on a deeper level. This wasn't just magic—it was architecture. We were rebuilding existence one thread at a time.

The tear began to close. Slowly at first, then faster as our techniques found purchase. The Devourer's intelligence became more apparent in its response—it retreated strategically, pulling back its tendrils and consolidating power rather than waste energy fighting a losing battle.

"It's learning from this too," I said as the tear sealed with a final snap of reality reasserting itself.

"Of course it is," Zephyra replied. "Which means our next encounter will be harder. It won't use the same tactics twice."

Around us, the evacuated crowd began cheering—werewolves howling victory, civilians emerging from shelter, even some Council members who'd witnessed the sealing looking impressed despite themselves.

But I couldn't share their relief. Because I'd felt something in those final moments of the sealing, something that chilled me more than the Devourer's raw power.

Intent. Purpose. Direction.

The Devourer wasn't just trying to unmake reality. It was trying to reach something specific. Or someone.

And I had a terrible suspicion I knew what—or who—it was after.

---

We reconvened in my study after the celebration died down, the core group that now functioned as our war council. Viktor, Corvinus, Morgana, Raechelle, Elena, Zephyra, and myself—seven people who understood the full scope of what we faced.

"The Devourer is intelligent," I began without preamble. "More than we initially thought. It's not just reacting to the paradox of two Prime Archons—it's hunting us specifically."

"How can you be sure?" Morgana asked, her notebook already open.

"The targeting patterns in Council Square. It wasn't attacking randomly—it was going after people and structures connected to us. And in those final moments of the sealing, I felt... intention. Like it was reaching for something beyond just unmaking reality."

"Reaching for what?" Viktor's question was blunt.

"Us," Zephyra said quietly. "It's trying to consume Prime Archon power directly. The paradox woke it, yes, but now it sees an opportunity. If it can devour our essence, absorb what makes us Prime Archons, it could become something worse than just a reality-correcting force."

"It could become permanent," Corvinus finished, understanding dawning on his ancient features. "A permanent part of existence rather than a temporary response to paradox."

"Which means it has motivation beyond simple balance restoration," I continued. "It wants to exist. To persist. And our power is the key to that."

"So we're not just fighting to seal it or banish it," Raechelle said. "We're fighting something that's actively trying to evolve into an unkillable threat."

Silence filled the study as that realization sank in.

"How much time do we have?" Elena asked quietly.

"Days," Zephyra said. "Maybe a week. Its manifestations are increasing in frequency and power. Soon it will have gathered enough strength for a full assault—and when that happens, it won't be probing attacks or strategic tests. It will come with everything it has, trying to consume us before we can mount a real defense."

"Then we need to be ready," I said, looking around at the faces of people I trusted with everything. "Zephyra, how much more training do I need before I can face it?"

"More than we have time for," she admitted. "But enough that you won't die immediately. That'll have to be sufficient."

"Viktor, status on the early warning network?"

"Operational," the werewolf alpha reported. "My packs are monitoring every confluence point we identified. First sign of a tear, we'll know immediately."

"Morgana?"

"I've been cross-referencing historical texts about reality-consuming entities," she said. "There's a pattern—they all had one thing in common. They could be damaged, even destroyed, but only by power operating on the same level as their existence. Which means—"

"Only Prime Archons can actually hurt it," I finished. "Conventional magic will slow it down, maybe seal breaches temporarily, but final confrontation requires Zephyra and me working together."

"A suicide mission against an evolving cosmic threat with insufficient preparation time," Corvinus summarized with dark humor. "This just gets better and better."

Despite everything, I found myself almost smiling. "When you put it that way, it sounds almost exciting."

"Your definition of 'exciting' needs serious revision," Raechelle muttered, but I felt affection through our bond alongside the worry.

"One more thing," I said, pulling out a map of our territories. "If the Devourer is targeting confluence points, there's one location that's essentially a bullseye—the Archon Spire in the northern territories. It sits on the largest confluence point in our entire region, where thirteen major ley lines intersect."

"If it attacks there—" Viktor began.

"It will," Zephyra interrupted. "That's where it will make its stand. Maximum power draw, maximum strategic advantage, and far enough from civilian populations that it won't have to waste energy on collateral damage. The Spire is where this ends."

"Then that's where we prepare," I decided. "Fortify the area, establish defensive positions, evacuate any civilians within fifty miles. When the Devourer comes in full force, we meet it there."

"A final battle," Elena said softly. "The kind that legends talk about."

"Or the kind that history forgets because nobody survived to tell the tale," I countered. "But yes. Final battle. Prime Archons versus reality-consuming entity. Winner takes existence."

"Very dramatic," Corvinus observed. "I approve. If we're all going to die horribly, at least it'll make for good mythology."

"We're not going to die," Raechelle said firmly. "We're going to win. Because we have to. Because there's no other option. Because I refuse to let some cosmic entity unmake my family."

The determination in her voice, in our bond, steadied me. She was right. We couldn't afford doubt, couldn't afford to consider failure. The stakes were too high, the consequences too absolute.

"Then let's get to work," I said. "We have a week at most to prepare for the fight of our lives. Let's make it count."

As the war council dispersed to their various tasks, I stood at the study window, looking out at the estate grounds. Beyond them, reality itself felt fragile—like glass under strain, ready to shatter at any moment.

Somewhere out there, the Devourer was gathering strength, preparing for its assault. And here, we were scrambling to build defenses against a threat that defied conventional understanding.

It should have been hopeless. Terrifying. Impossible.

But as I felt Raechelle's hand slip into mine, as I sensed Elena practicing in the training room with fierce determination, as I remembered the loyalty of allies who stood with me despite knowing the odds—I realized something.

Maybe impossible was just another challenge to overcome. Another barrier to break through. Another limit to prove was only temporary.

After all, I was a Prime Archon. The universe itself bent around my power.

And if the universe wanted to send something to kill me?

Well, the universe was about to learn that Riven Sixxx didn't die easily.
