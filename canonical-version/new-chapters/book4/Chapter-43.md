# Chapter 43: Ancient Powers

**Word Count**: ~7,000 words  
**POV**: Riven Sixxx  
**Timeline**: Three days after Chapter 42's Council revelation

---

The alarm shattered the pre-dawn stillness of our bedroom with a shrill, urgent wail that had my heart racing before I was fully conscious.

*Reality breach detected. Northern territories. Confluence point seven.*

Raechelle was already moving beside me, vampire reflexes having her dressed and ready before I'd even thrown the covers off. Through our bond, I felt her battle-ready calm overlaying the anxiety that never quite left anymore. Three days since the Council revelation, and we'd already responded to six minor reality tears across our territories.

This was the seventh.

And according to Viktor's early warning network, it was the largest yet.

"How bad?" Raechelle asked as I pulled on combat-ready clothing, her voice tight with the controlled tension of someone expecting the worst.

I reached out with my expanded senses, feeling along the ley lines that connected our territories like a vast nervous system. The disturbance in the north felt like a wound—a gaping tear in reality's fabric that pulsed with the Devourer's hungry void-energy.

"Bad," I said grimly. "It's not a probe this time. This is a full assault."

My phone lit up with incoming calls simultaneously—Viktor, Corvinus, Morgana, even Lady Seraphina from the Council. I ignored them all for now, instead opening a direct line to Zephyra through the communication crystal she'd given me.

Her voice came through immediately, sharp with urgency. "I feel it. The northern tear. It's testing our coordination, seeing how quickly we can respond."

"Then let's not disappoint it," I replied, already moving toward the door. "Meet me at the breach point in ten minutes."

"Make it five. And Riven?" Her tone shifted, taking on a warning edge. "This won't be like Council Square. The Devourer has learned from our previous encounters. Expect adaptation."

The crystal went dark before I could respond.

---

We arrived at the northern territories to find chaos already unfolding.

The reality tear hung in the air like a wound in existence itself—a ragged gash perhaps fifty feet across, spilling void-energy and writhing tendrils that lashed out at everything nearby. But unlike the previous tears we'd sealed, this one was *organized*. The tendrils moved with coordinated purpose, working together to expand the breach rather than simply thrashing randomly.

And they were winning.

Viktor's werewolf packs had formed a defensive perimeter around the tear, keeping civilians back while his elite warriors harried the tendrils with claw and fang. But even their enhanced regeneration couldn't keep pace with the injuries they were sustaining. I watched one massive werewolf—probably Viktor's second-in-command—get caught by three tendrils simultaneously and slammed into the ground hard enough to crater the earth.

"About time you showed up," Viktor growled as Raechelle and I touched down at the command position he'd established. Blood matted his fur from a dozen shallow wounds, but his eyes were sharp and focused. "We've been holding this thing for twenty minutes, but we're running out of bodies."

"Pull your people back," I ordered, already beginning to channel power. "Establish a secondary perimeter—anyone who gets too close to those tendrils risks getting unmade entirely."

"Already learned that lesson," Viktor replied grimly, gesturing to an area cordoned off with warning markers. "Lost two scouts in the first five minutes. The void-energy doesn't just kill—it erases. No bodies to recover, no death wounds to heal. They just... stopped existing."

The cold certainty in his voice made my blood run cold. The Devourer wasn't just destroying—it was unmaking. Removing people from reality entirely, as if they'd never been.

Zephyra arrived in a flash of multi-colored Prime Archon power, her ancient presence immediately drawing attention from the assembled defenders. She assessed the tear with a single glance, her expression darkening.

"This is worse than I anticipated," she said quietly. "Look at the pattern of the tendrils."

I focused, using the enhanced sight she'd been training me to develop. The tendrils weren't just moving randomly—they were forming something. A structure. A *shape* that seemed to shimmer at the edges of perception, existing partially outside normal reality.

"It's building something," I realized with growing horror. "Some kind of anchor point."

"Exactly." Zephyra's voice was grim. "If it completes that structure, this tear becomes permanent. A gateway the Devourer can use to manifest fully without needing to force its way through reality's barriers each time."

"Then we seal it before it finishes," Raechelle said, power already crackling around her hands. "The three of us together—"

"Won't be enough," I interrupted, hating the words even as I spoke them. "Look at the scale of this thing. We'd need..." I trailed off, doing rapid calculations based on what Zephyra had taught me about reality manipulation. "We'd need at least a dozen powerful magic users working in coordination to seal something this size."

"Then call them," Viktor said simply. "You're the Balance. You coordinated the Council. Use that political capital."

He made it sound so simple. But three days ago, I'd stood before that same Council and revealed myself as a Prime Archon—a being many of them feared and some wanted dead. Political capital was in short supply right now.

But he was right. We didn't have a choice.

I pulled out my phone and started making calls.

---

Within thirty minutes, we had assembled what would have been impossible just weeks ago—a coordinated response team from multiple supernatural factions working together.

Morgana arrived with a contingent of witches from her coven, immediately beginning to establish ritual circles that could channel and focus magical energy. Corvinus brought vampire specialists in blood magic who could sense and manipulate the life-force energies that reality itself was built upon. Lady Seraphina Darkthorne showed up with her personal guard—not out of loyalty to me, I suspected, but because even she recognized the existential threat this represented.

And surprisingly, Elena insisted on coming.

"Absolutely not," I told her firmly as she materialized beside me through a blood-gate she'd clearly mastered despite my explicit instructions to stay at the estate. "This is too dangerous."

"Everything is too dangerous now," she shot back, her fifteen-year-old defiance tempered by genuine determination. "You said yourself—we need every capable magic user. I'm a Blood Archon. I'm capable."

"You're also my daughter, and I won't risk—"

"You don't get to make that choice anymore," Elena interrupted, and the steel in her voice stopped me cold. "Not when reality itself is at stake. Not when people are dying because we don't have enough power to seal these breaches fast enough. You taught me to fight. You trained me to use my abilities. Now let me use them."

I wanted to argue. Every paternal instinct screamed at me to protect her, to send her somewhere safe, to shield her from the horrors that the Devourer represented. But as I looked into her eyes—so much like Raechelle's in their fierce determination, yet carrying my own stubborn refusal to back down—I realized she was right.

She wasn't a child anymore. The world had stripped that luxury away the moment the Devourer manifested.

"Stay behind the primary defenders," I finally said, hating every word. "Support role only—channeling power to the seal team, not engaging tendrils directly. Understood?"

"Understood." Elena's expression softened slightly. "I'll be careful, Dad. I promise."

Raechelle moved beside me as Elena jogged toward Morgana's ritual position, our bond humming with shared anxiety and reluctant pride.

"She reminds me of you," Raechelle murmured. "Stubborn. Brave. Unwilling to hide while others fight."

"She reminds me of you," I countered. "Fierce. Protective of those she cares about. Stronger than anyone realizes."

"Then she's got the best of both of us," Raechelle said, squeezing my hand briefly before releasing it. "Now let's make sure she has a world to grow up in."

---

The coordinated sealing attempt was unlike anything I'd ever attempted.

Zephyra and I positioned ourselves at the primary anchor points of the reality tear, serving as the main channels for the sealing magic. Morgana's witches formed an outer circle, their ritual magic providing structure and framework. Corvinus's vampire specialists connected to the deeper currents of life-energy that flowed through reality itself. Lady Seraphina's guard maintained defensive positions, ready to intercept any tendrils that broke through our concentration.

And Elena, along with several other young Archons, formed a supporting network—channeling raw power to those of us doing the actual sealing work.

"On my mark," Zephyra called out, her voice carrying with supernatural clarity to every person present. "We all push together. If anyone breaks concentration, the backlash could kill us all. Understood?"

A chorus of acknowledgments rippled through the assembled defenders.

"Three... two... one... NOW!"

Power surged through me like nothing I'd ever felt—not just my own Prime Archon abilities, but the combined might of dozens of supernatural beings all channeling their magic through me as a focal point. It was overwhelming, exhilarating, and terrifying all at once.

I thrust that power toward the reality tear, feeling Zephyra doing the same from her position. Our energies met in the center of the breach, weaving together with the practiced synchronization we'd developed over the past three days of training.

The Devourer noticed immediately.

The tendrils whipped toward us with sudden, vicious intent. No longer focused on building their anchor structure, they attacked with the singular purpose of disrupting our concentration. I felt Lady Seraphina's guards engage them, heard Viktor's werewolves howling battle cries as they intercepted the ones that broke through the first defensive line.

But some got through.

A tendril materialized beside Morgana's ritual circle, moving faster than should have been possible. It lashed out toward the witches—toward Elena, I realized with sudden horror—and in that frozen instant, I had to make an impossible choice.

Break concentration to save my daughter, and doom everyone here.

Or trust her training and keep sealing the breach.

*Trust her,* Raechelle's voice echoed through our bond, steady despite the fear I felt mirroring my own. *She's ready.*

Elena saw the tendril coming. Instead of freezing or panicking, she reacted with the instincts I'd drilled into her through years of training. Her hands came up, blood magic flaring to life in a defensive shield that caught the tendril's strike and deflected it away from the ritual circle.

The impact drove her to one knee, blood trickling from her nose from the strain. But the shield held. And more importantly, she kept channeling power to the sealing effort even as she maintained her defense.

Pride surged through me so intensely that I almost lost my own concentration. That was my daughter. Stubborn, brave, and strong enough to hold her ground against cosmic horror.

"Focus, Riven!" Zephyra's sharp command snapped me back to the task at hand.

I redoubled my efforts, weaving reality back together thread by thread. The Devourer fought us every step of the way—its intelligence apparent in how it targeted the weakest points of our seal, how it adapted its attacks to exploit the slightest gap in our coordination.

But we were learning too. Each encounter taught us more about how it operated, what it could and couldn't do, where its limitations lay. And slowly, agonizingly, we began to win.

The reality tear started to close. Not quickly—this wasn't like Council Square where Zephyra and I had sealed it in minutes. This took sustained effort from everyone present, a grinding battle of wills between us and the void.

Twenty minutes passed. Then thirty. My muscles screamed from the strain of channeling so much power. I felt several of the supporting channelers drop out, exhausted beyond their limits. But others took their places, rotating through so the power flow never completely dropped.

Forty minutes. The tear was half-closed now, the anchor structure the Devourer had been building crumbling under our assault. Its tendrils lashed out with increasing desperation, but they were weakening—unable to maintain their presence in our reality without the stable gateway.

"Almost there," Zephyra called out, though I heard the strain in her voice. Even three thousand years of experience couldn't make this easy. "One final push—everyone together!"

We gave it everything we had left. Every ounce of power, every fragment of will, every desperate hope that we could actually win this fight. The reality tear collapsed inward with a sound like shattering glass mixed with a dying scream, and then—

Silence.

The breach was sealed. Reality reasserted itself with an almost audible snap, the natural order reimposing itself where the Devourer had tried to unmake it.

And then people started collapsing.

---

The aftermath was exhausting in a way that pure combat never was.

Morgana's witches were drained to the point of unconsciousness, their ritual magic having burned through reserves they'd need weeks to rebuild. Corvinus's vampires weren't much better—their life-energy manipulation had cost them dearly, leaving several in a weakened state that would take days of feeding to recover from.

Elena was on her feet, but barely. The combined effort of maintaining her shield and channeling power to the seal had pushed her past her limits. Raechelle caught her as she stumbled, and I rushed over to find my daughter pale but alive, a fierce pride shining in her exhausted eyes.

"I held," she whispered. "I didn't break."

"You did more than hold," I told her, brushing bloodstained hair from her face. "You saved lives. You proved yourself worthy of being called an Archon."

"Worth it," she mumbled, then promptly passed out in Raechelle's arms.

Viktor approached, his massive werewolf form somehow looking smaller after the battle. Blood still matted his fur, and I could see he was favoring his left side where one of the tendrils had gotten through his defenses.

"Final count?" I asked, dreading the answer.

"Five dead," he reported grimly. "Two of mine, three civilians who were too close when the tear opened. Nineteen seriously wounded. And that's not counting the two scouts who were erased entirely at the beginning."

Seven casualties. For what we'd been fighting, it could have been so much worse. But each death was still a weight on my conscience—people who died because the universe itself was trying to correct the paradox of my existence.

"We'll honor them," I said quietly. "Make sure their families are taken care of. Their sacrifice won't be forgotten."

"Already arranged," Viktor said. "But Riven... this was just one tear. What happens when the Devourer attacks multiple locations simultaneously? We barely had enough power to seal this breach. If it splits our attention—"

"I know." The strategic implications were already churning through my mind. "We need more than just rapid response. We need a way to predict where it will attack next, or better yet, prevent the attacks entirely."

"How do you prevent something that exists outside normal reality?" Lady Seraphina had approached without me noticing, her expression thoughtful rather than hostile for once. "I'll admit, Riven, your coordination here was impressive. But even I can see the mathematics of attrition. The Devourer can attempt as many breaches as it wants. We have limited defenders and even more limited energy reserves. Eventually, something will slip through our defenses."

She wasn't wrong. The thought of facing multiple breaches simultaneously made my blood run cold. Today's battle had required every resource we could muster—if the Devourer had opened even one more tear at the same time, we'd have had to choose which one to seal first. And the other would have claimed countless lives.

"Then we need to change the equation," I said, an idea beginning to form. "Zephyra, you said the Devourer targets confluence points—places where ley lines intersect. Can we... shield them somehow? Create barriers that prevent it from manifesting there in the first place?"

Zephyra materialized beside us, her earlier battle fatigue hidden behind renewed focus. "In theory, yes. We'd need to establish magical wards at every major confluence point in your territories. But that's hundreds of locations, and the power required to maintain those wards continuously..."

"Would drain our resources even faster than responding to attacks," Corvinus finished, having joined our impromptu strategy session. "We'd be spreading ourselves so thin that any breach that *did* occur would find us with no power left to seal it."

I wanted to scream in frustration. Every solution we considered came with impossible trade-offs. React to attacks and exhaust ourselves through attrition. Shield everywhere and weaken ourselves proactively. There had to be another option, something we weren't seeing—

My phone buzzed with an incoming call. Morgana's name flashed on the screen.

"How are you even conscious enough to make calls?" I answered, knowing she'd been among the most drained after the ritual work.

"Stimulant potion and spite," she replied, her voice rough but alert. "Listen, I've been going through the texts I recovered about reality-consuming entities. There's something I think you need to see. Something that might explain why the Devourer is behaving the way it is."

"Can it wait? We're dealing with aftermath here, and people need—"

"No, it can't wait," Morgana interrupted firmly. "Because if I'm right, the Devourer isn't just trying to unmake reality or consume your power. It's following a specific pattern. And that pattern suggests it has a primary objective we haven't identified yet."

That got everyone's attention. Lady Seraphina leaned in closer, Viktor's ears perked forward, and Zephyra's expression sharpened with interest.

"What kind of objective?" I asked carefully.

"That's the problem—I'm not certain yet. But Riven, every documented case of reality-consuming entities shows them pursuing a specific goal. They don't just attack randomly. They're looking for something, or trying to achieve something. And once I know what that is..."

"We can predict its actions," I finished. "Maybe even get ahead of it instead of constantly reacting."

"Exactly. Come to my sanctum as soon as you can. Bring Zephyra—I need her historical perspective on some of these references. And..." She paused, then added reluctantly, "Bring Lady Seraphina too. Some of these texts reference vampire archives that Corvinus doesn't have access to. If we're going to solve this puzzle, we need every piece of information available."

After hanging up, I found myself looking at the assembled group—former rivals and uneasy allies united by necessity against an existential threat. Viktor, loyal to a fault. Corvinus, ancient and wise. Lady Seraphina, calculating but pragmatic. Zephyra, woman out of time carrying the weight of millennia. Morgana, brilliant and determined.

And Raechelle, holding our unconscious daughter, her eyes meeting mine with perfect understanding.

We were fighting something that shouldn't exist against odds that no rational person would accept. But we were doing it together. And somehow, that had to be enough.

"All right," I said, straightening despite my exhaustion. "Let's figure out what this thing actually wants. Because if we understand its objective, we can stop reacting and start taking the fight to it."

---

Morgana's sanctum was exactly what you'd expect from a powerful witch—a converted warehouse in the industrial district filled with books, artifacts, and magical instruments that hummed with latent power. The walls were covered in protective wards so dense they made my eyes water to look at directly, and the air itself tasted of old magic and older secrets.

She'd spread out her findings across a massive central table—ancient texts, modern research notes, and arcane diagrams that seemed to shift when I wasn't looking directly at them.

"All right," Morgana began without preamble once we'd all assembled. "I've cross-referenced every documented encounter with reality-consuming entities over the past six thousand years. There are seventeen confirmed cases. In fourteen of them, the entity was successfully defeated or sealed. In two cases, they achieved their objective and departed. In one case..." She paused, her expression darkening. "The entity won completely. An entire civilization was unmade so thoroughly that we only know they existed through second-hand references in other cultures' texts."

"Cheerful," Viktor muttered.

"But informative," Zephyra said, leaning forward to study the documents. "Because you said it—in two cases, the entities achieved their objective and left. Which means they *have* objectives. What were they?"

"That's where it gets interesting," Morgana replied, pulling forward two specific documents. "In both cases, the entities were after a specific magical artifact. Not to destroy it—to consume it. To absorb its power and integrate that power into their own existence."

My blood ran cold. "You think the Devourer is after an artifact?"

"I think the Devourer is after *power*," Morgana corrected. "Specifically, unique power that doesn't exist anywhere else. In those two historical cases, the artifacts were one-of-a-kind magical constructs with abilities nothing else in reality possessed. The entities consumed them not for destruction, but for evolution."

"To become permanent," Corvinus breathed. "Just as you theorized after Council Square. It wants to consume something so unique that integrating it would make the Devourer a permanent fixture of reality rather than a temporary correction mechanism."

"And the only thing that qualifies in our current reality..." Lady Seraphina said slowly, her calculating gaze fixing on me and Zephyra. "Would be Prime Archon power. The rarest, most unique power source in existence."

"But there's more," Morgana continued, ignoring the sudden tension in the room. "Look at the pattern of attacks." She gestured to a map she'd created showing all the reality tears that had manifested. "Council Square—seven ley lines. The northern territories today—nine ley lines. The smaller probes you've sealed over the past three days—all between three and five ley lines."

"It's escalating," I noted. "Going after more powerful confluence points each time."

"Yes, but *why*?" Morgana challenged. "If it just wanted to consume you and Zephyra, it would attack you directly. Instead, it's systematically targeting increasingly powerful magical nexus points. And if we project the pattern forward..." She traced a line on the map that made my stomach drop.

The line led directly to the Archon Spire.

"Thirteen ley lines," Zephyra said quietly. "The most powerful confluence point in the entire region. We already knew it would attack there for the final confrontation."

"But what if that's not why?" Morgana pressed. "What if the Spire itself is the target? What if there's something *at* the Spire that the Devourer wants?"

Silence filled the sanctum as that implication sank in.

"The Spire is ancient," Corvinus said slowly. "Built three thousand years ago by the first Blood Archons as both a monument and a..." He trailed off, realization dawning. "A repository. For knowledge, power, artifacts too dangerous to be kept elsewhere."

"What kind of artifacts?" I asked, though part of me already knew the answer.

"Prime Archon artifacts," Zephyra confirmed, her voice hollow with memory. "When Marcus died, his personal effects were sealed at the Spire. Weapons he'd forged. Techniques he'd developed. And..." She looked at me directly. "His blood. A significant amount of it, preserved in stasis as a genetic archive in case future Blood Archons needed to access it."

My hand unconsciously went to Marcus's ring on my finger. "You're saying the Devourer doesn't just want to consume us. It wants to consume Marcus's preserved legacy too. Everything that made him a Prime Archon."

"Think about it," Morgana said urgently. "Two living Prime Archons plus the preserved essence of a third. If the Devourer could consume all three sources of Prime Archon power, it would have everything it needs to become permanent. Not just survive, but *transcend*—become something that reality itself couldn't reject anymore."

"Which means our timeline just changed," Viktor growled. "It's not building up power for a final assault on the Spire. It's eliminating obstacles and conserving strength for one massive attack aimed at the repository. And when it makes that attack—"

"It will come with everything it has," I finished. "No holding back, no testing defenses. One overwhelming assault designed to breach the Spire's protections before we can respond."

"How long do we have?" Raechelle asked quietly. She'd remained silent throughout the briefing, but I felt her growing concern through our bond.

Morgana consulted her notes, cross-referencing several texts. "Based on the escalation pattern and the energy signature of today's attack... three days. Maybe four. And that's assuming it doesn't accelerate the timetable if it realizes we've figured out its objective."

Three days. Maybe four. To prepare for a battle that would determine whether reality itself survived.

"Then we don't wait," I decided, the plan crystallizing in my mind even as I spoke. "We evacuate the Spire's repository. Move Marcus's legacy to a secure location the Devourer can't predict. If it attacks the Spire expecting to find the artifacts there and finds nothing—"

"It will adapt," Zephyra interrupted. "Hunt for the new location. We'd buy time, yes, but not much. And moving artifacts of that power level... every supernatural faction will sense it. You'd be advertising that you have something valuable enough to relocate, making yourself a target not just for the Devourer but for anyone who wants Prime Archon power for themselves."

She wasn't wrong. But I was tired of reacting, tired of dancing to the Devourer's rhythm.

"Then we use that," I said firmly. "Make the relocation obvious. Draw attention. Because while everyone is watching the transport, we set a trap at the Spire. When the Devourer attacks expecting to find the repository, it finds us instead—ready, prepared, and dug in for a fight."

"A final battle," Lady Seraphina murmured. "On our terms rather than waiting for it to choose the time and place."

"Exactly. We've been playing defense. It's time to go on the offense."

Viktor grinned, all teeth and battle-hungry anticipation. "Now *that* sounds like a plan. When do we start?"

"Now," I said, looking around at each person present. "Because in three days, we end this. One way or another."

---

The next seventy-two hours were a controlled chaos of preparation.

Viktor's packs established fortified positions around the Archon Spire, creating defensive layers that would force the Devourer to fight through multiple barriers to reach the central chamber. Morgana and her witches crafted ritual circles designed specifically to channel anti-reality energy—weapons that could actually harm something that existed partially outside normal existence.

Corvinus organized evacuation protocols for civilian populations within a hundred miles of the Spire. Lady Seraphina, to her credit, used her political influence to secure cooperation from factions that had been on the fence about supporting our efforts.

And Zephyra trained me relentlessly.

"Again," she commanded as I collapsed from the latest exercise, sweat pouring down my face and muscles screaming in protest. "You need to be able to maintain five-affinity manifestation for at least thirty minutes if you want to survive the fight. Right now you're barely hitting ten."

"Because it feels like trying to juggle chainsaws while running a marathon," I gasped, but forced myself back to my feet. "The energy drain alone—"

"Will kill you if you don't learn to manage it," Zephyra finished bluntly. "Prime Archon power isn't just about having five affinities. It's about sustaining them simultaneously without burning yourself out. Marcus could fight for hours at full power. You need to at least approach that level."

She was right, of course. But that didn't make the training any less brutal.

Raechelle watched from the sidelines, ready to intervene if I pushed too far, her concern a constant presence through our bond. Elena had wanted to participate in the training, but I'd firmly (and after much argument) convinced her that her role would be in the support network—channeling power to the primary fighters rather than engaging directly.

On the second day, as Viktor's wolves dug in defensive positions and Morgana's witches established their ritual circles, reality tears started appearing with increasing frequency. Small ones, probes testing our defenses. We sealed each one efficiently, but the pattern was clear—the Devourer was scouting, learning our capabilities, assessing our readiness.

It knew we were preparing. And it was preparing too.

On the third day, something changed.

The probes stopped. The reality tears ceased manifesting. An eerie calm settled over our territories, the kind of stillness that comes before a storm.

"It's coming," Zephyra said quietly as we stood atop the Archon Spire, looking out over the assembled defenders. "Tonight, or early tomorrow. I can feel it gathering strength, marshaling everything it has."

"Are we ready?" I asked, knowing the question was almost meaningless. Were we ever ready for something like this?

"Ready as we'll ever be," Zephyra replied. Then, surprisingly, she placed a hand on my shoulder—the first time she'd offered anything resembling comfort since we'd met. "Marcus would be proud of you, you know. The way you've brought people together, coordinated this defense. He could wield incredible power, but he struggled with leadership. You have both."

"I'm not sure it will be enough."

"It will have to be," she said simply. "Because there's no alternative. We fight, we win, or we cease to exist. Those are the only options."

As if summoned by her words, the horizon flickered. Once, twice, then continuously—reality itself beginning to tear along every confluence point simultaneously.

The Devourer was here.

And it was bringing everything.
