# Chapter 43: Ancient Powers

**Word Count**: ~15,800 words  
**POV**: Riven Sixxx  
**Timeline**: Three days after Chapter 42's Council revelation

---

The alarm shattered the pre-dawn stillness of our bedroom with a shrill, urgent wail that had my heart racing before I was fully conscious.

Three days. That's how long we'd been living like this—sleeping in shifts, jumping at every alert, running from one crisis to the next. Three days since I'd stood before the Council and revealed myself as a Prime Archon, since the carefully constructed facade of normalcy had been ripped away and replaced with this new reality of constant vigilance.

Three days, and I was already exhausted in ways that had nothing to do with physical fatigue.

The alarm continued its shriek, the magical resonance of it vibrating through my bones with an urgency that transcended mere sound. This wasn't the low-level alert we'd been getting for the minor probes—those reality tears that popped up, tested our defenses, and vanished before we could fully engage. This was the emergency klaxon, the one that meant *drop everything and move now*.

*Someone's going to die tonight,* I thought with the grim certainty of someone who'd seen too much death already. *The only question is how many.*

*Reality breach detected. Northern territories. Confluence point seven.*

The magical voice echoed through my consciousness, clinical and precise, delivering information that would determine whether people lived or died in the next hour. Confluence point seven. Nine ley lines intersecting in a single location, creating a nexus of power that made reality itself thin and vulnerable. If the Devourer had manifested there—and the alarm's urgency suggested it had—we were looking at a breach that could consume everything within a mile radius before we had a chance to contain it.

*Move faster,* I commanded my still-sluggish body, forcing awareness into limbs that wanted nothing more than to collapse back into bed and pretend the universe wasn't actively trying to unmake itself.

Raechelle was already moving beside me, vampire reflexes having her dressed and ready before I'd even thrown the covers off. Through our bond, I felt her battle-ready calm overlaying the anxiety that never quite left anymore. She'd perfected the art of controlled fear over the past three days—acknowledging the danger while refusing to let it paralyze her. I drew strength from that steadiness, using it to anchor myself as I pulled on the combat-ready clothing we'd taken to keeping laid out beside the bed.

No more pajamas for us. These days, we slept in gear that could transition to battle in seconds. Reinforced clothing that could withstand supernatural attacks, boots that wouldn't fail in rough terrain, countless pockets filled with emergency supplies and weapons. We looked like soldiers preparing for war.

Which, I supposed with dark humor, we were.

Three days since the Council revelation, and we'd already responded to six minor reality tears across our territories. Small probes, testing our response time, learning our capabilities, pushing at the boundaries of what we could defend. Each one we'd sealed efficiently—sometimes alone, sometimes with Zephyra's assistance, once with a quick response team that Viktor had assembled specifically for these emergencies.

This was the seventh.

And according to Viktor's early warning network, it was the largest yet.

*Of course it is,* I thought bitterly. *Because the universe has decided that escalation is the name of the game now.*

"How bad?" Raechelle asked as I pulled on combat-ready clothing, her voice tight with the controlled tension of someone expecting the worst.

I reached out with my expanded senses, feeling along the ley lines that connected our territories like a vast nervous system. The disturbance in the north felt like a wound—a gaping tear in reality's fabric that pulsed with the Devourer's hungry void-energy. But worse than that, I could feel the *wrongness* of it. The way reality itself recoiled from the breach, the natural order of existence screaming in silent agony as something that shouldn't exist forced its way into spaces that couldn't contain it.

The sensation made me want to vomit. Made me want to hide under the covers and pretend none of this was happening. Made me want to grab Raechelle and Elena and run as far and fast as we could, putting distance between us and the cosmic horror that was systematically unmaking everything we'd built.

*But running won't help,* I reminded myself for the thousandth time. *It's here because of me. Because I exist. Because Marcus's ring changed me into something reality itself can't accept. And no amount of distance will change that fundamental equation.*

"Bad," I said grimly, forcing my voice to remain steady despite the churning in my gut. "It's not a probe this time. This is a full assault."

I watched Raechelle's jaw tighten, saw the momentary flash of fear in her eyes before her iron self-control reasserted itself. She'd been a warrior long before she became a vampire, and that training ran deep. Fear was information, not paralysis. Acknowledge it, process it, use it to sharpen your focus, then move forward.

*I love you so much,* I thought, not for the first time marveling at the strength of the woman who'd chosen to stand beside me through this madness.

My phone lit up with incoming calls simultaneously—Viktor, Corvinus, Morgana, even Lady Seraphina from the Council. Everyone who mattered, everyone who'd positioned themselves as either ally or watchful neutral over the past three days. I ignored them all for now, instead opening a direct line to Zephyra through the communication crystal she'd given me.

The crystal warmed in my palm, its faceted surface glowing with soft blue-white light that reminded me uncomfortably of the void-energy we were fighting against. But this light was different—contained, controlled, a tool rather than a weapon. Zephyra had crafted it personally, weaving her own essence into the matrix to create a connection that transcended normal communication methods.

*"Because when reality is breaking, phones won't work,"* she'd explained with grim practicality. *"The void disrupts electromagnetic signals. But essence-to-essence communication? That's more fundamental. Harder to disrupt."*

Her voice came through immediately, sharp with urgency and something else—anticipation, maybe? Or the battle-hunger of someone who'd fought these kinds of threats before and knew the grim satisfaction of meeting them head-on. "I feel it. The northern tear. It's testing our coordination, seeing how quickly we can respond."

"Then let's not disappoint it," I replied, already moving toward the door. My legs felt steadier now, the initial grogginess burned away by adrenaline and necessity. Behind me, I heard Raechelle gathering her weapons—the reinforced blades that could channel blood magic, the throwing knives coated in silver and blessed with protective enchantments, the small arsenal we'd accumulated as our understanding of what we were fighting had evolved. "Meet me at the breach point in ten minutes."

"Make it five. And Riven?" Her tone shifted, taking on a warning edge that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. "This won't be like Council Square. The Devourer has learned from our previous encounters. Expect adaptation."

The crystal went dark before I could respond, leaving me staring at the now-inert gem and feeling a cold dread settle in my stomach.

Adaptation. Of course it was adapting. Because fighting a reality-consuming entity that operated on instinct alone would have been too easy. Instead, we were facing something with intelligence, something that learned from its failures and adjusted its tactics accordingly.

*Just like me,* I realized with uncomfortable insight. *We're both trying to survive in a reality that's fundamentally hostile to our existence. Both evolving, adapting, learning. The only difference is I'm trying to preserve reality, and it's trying to consume it.*

The parallel was disturbing enough that I pushed it aside, focusing instead on the immediate crisis. Philosophy could wait. Right now, people were dying.

---

We arrived at the northern territories to find chaos already unfolding.

The reality tear hung in the air like a wound in existence itself—a ragged gash perhaps fifty feet across, spilling void-energy and writhing tendrils that lashed out at everything nearby. The edges of the tear shimmered with colors that didn't exist in normal spectrum, hues that made my eyes water and my brain struggle to process what it was seeing. Looking at it directly was like trying to stare at the sun, if the sun was made of anti-matter and hate.

The temperature around the breach fluctuated wildly, one moment dropping to subzero cold that frosted my breath, the next surging to desert heat that made sweat bead on my forehead. The air itself tasted wrong—metallic and sharp, with an underlying bitterness that coated my tongue and made me want to spit. Every breath felt like inhaling ground glass mixed with ozone and something else, something that didn't belong in lungs designed for oxygen and nitrogen.

Sounds distorted near the tear. Werewolf howls stretched into impossibly long notes that hung in the air like dying songs. The crackle of magic became a percussion of reality fighting reality, each impact sending ripples through space that I could feel more than see. And underneath it all, a subsonic thrumming that vibrated through my bones and made my teeth ache—the sound of the universe screaming as it was torn open.

But unlike the previous tears we'd sealed, this one was *organized*. The tendrils moved with coordinated purpose, working together to expand the breach rather than simply thrashing randomly. I watched as three tendrils wrapped around the edges of the tear and *pulled*, widening it like hands forcing open a wound. Another cluster of tendrils had formed a defensive perimeter, intercepting attacks from Viktor's werewolves with almost precognitive accuracy.

And they were winning.

The ground around the breach had already begun to *unmake* itself. Not destroyed, not damaged—unmade. Grass didn't wilt or burn; it simply ceased to exist, leaving behind ground that looked less like earth and more like the concept of ground painted by someone who'd only heard it described second-hand. Buildings at the edge of the affected area flickered between existence and non-existence, their substance becoming uncertain, as if reality couldn't quite decide whether they should be there or not.

*This is what winning looks like for the Devourer,* I realized with sickening certainty. *Not conquest, not domination. Just... absence. The erasure of everything that is, leaving behind the void that was before existence began.*

Viktor's werewolf packs had formed a defensive perimeter around the tear, keeping civilians back while his elite warriors harried the tendrils with claw and fang. But even their enhanced regeneration couldn't keep pace with the injuries they were sustaining. I watched one massive werewolf—probably Viktor's second-in-command, a brute named Marcus (no relation to my predecessor, just one of those unfortunate coincidences) who stood nearly nine feet tall in hybrid form—get caught by three tendrils simultaneously.

The tendrils moved like living whips, wrapping around his arms and torso with terrifying speed. Marcus roared defiance, his enhanced strength allowing him to tear free from one tendril even as the other two tightened their grip. His claws raked across void-energy, leaving trails of disruption that made the tendrils writhe in what might have been pain.

Then they slammed him into the ground.

The impact was devastating. Earth cratered beneath Marcus's body, concentric rings of shattered ground radiating outward from the point of impact. I heard bones break even from my distance, the sharp crack of supernatural physiology being pushed beyond its limits. Blood sprayed from his muzzle, and for a terrible moment I thought we were about to watch him die.

But Marcus was Viktor's second for a reason. Even as the tendrils tried to drag him toward the tear, toward the void that would unmake him entirely, he caught himself. Claws dug into earth that was still mostly solid, muscles bunched with desperate strength, and he arrested his slide. Another werewolf—female, smaller but faster—darted in and severed one tendril with a claw strike that channeled pack magic, and Marcus used the momentary reprieve to wrench himself free and retreat.

He was alive. But the injury to his left side was severe enough that I could see it even from a distance. And there were dozens more werewolves in similar states, fighting with everything they had but slowly, inevitably, being pushed back.

"About time you showed up," Viktor growled as Raechelle and I touched down at the command position he'd established. Blood matted his fur from a dozen shallow wounds, and one of his ears was partially missing—torn away by a tendril that had come too close. But his eyes were sharp and focused, the predatory intelligence that made him such an effective alpha still fully engaged despite the pain. "We've been holding this thing for twenty minutes, but we're running out of bodies."

Twenty minutes. Gods, they'd held for twenty minutes against something that could unmake reality itself. The sheer determination that required made my chest tight with respect and guilt. They'd been dying to buy time for me to arrive, to bring the power necessary to seal this breach before it consumed everything.

*How many times can I ask people to die for me before it becomes unforgivable?*

"Pull your people back," I ordered, already beginning to channel power. My five affinities stirred within me—blood, ice, shadow, fire, and lightning—responding to my will with the eager readiness of weapons too long sheathed. "Establish a secondary perimeter—anyone who gets too close to those tendrils risks getting unmade entirely."

"Already learned that lesson," Viktor replied grimly, gesturing with one massive paw to an area cordoned off with warning markers. Simple wooden stakes driven into the ground with red cloth tied between them, creating a boundary that was more psychological than physical. But it worked. I could see where werewolves pulled back rather than cross that line, even when it meant abandoning advantageous positions. "Lost two scouts in the first five minutes. The void-energy doesn't just kill—it erases. No bodies to recover, no death wounds to heal. They just... stopped existing."

The cold certainty in his voice made my blood run cold. I'd known intellectually that the Devourer didn't just destroy—it unmade. But hearing it confirmed, understanding that two people had simply been removed from existence so thoroughly that even werewolf regeneration couldn't save them...

*That's what I'm fighting,* I reminded myself. *Not just death. Oblivion. The complete erasure of everything someone was, is, or could have been. And if I fail, that's the fate awaiting everyone in my territories. Everyone I've sworn to protect.*

The weight of that responsibility threatened to crush me. But I'd learned over the past three days how to compartmentalize, how to push the fear and guilt into a mental box labeled "deal with later" so I could focus on the immediate crisis. It wasn't healthy. Morgana had made that very clear during one of our strategy sessions. But it was necessary.

*Survival first. Sanity second. I can have a breakdown once reality stops trying to implode.*

Zephyra arrived in a flash of multi-colored Prime Archon power, her ancient presence immediately drawing attention from the assembled defenders. Where I'd learned to fly through blood magic and ice manipulation, she simply *moved* through space, bending reality to bring her from wherever she'd been to where she needed to be. The transition left afterimages in the air—ghostly copies of herself that faded slowly, as if existence itself needed a moment to reconcile that she'd been somewhere else just an instant ago.

She assessed the tear with a single glance, those ancient eyes taking in details that I was still learning to perceive. Her expression darkened, lines of concern etching themselves deeper into features that could have been anywhere from thirty to three thousand years old depending on the light.

"This is worse than I anticipated," she said quietly, her voice pitched for just our small group despite the chaos surrounding us. "Look at the pattern of the tendrils."

I focused, using the enhanced sight she'd been training me to develop. It was like switching from normal vision to thermal imaging—suddenly I could see layers of reality that normal perception couldn't access. The ley lines became visible as threads of power, and the tendrils...

Oh hell.

The tendrils weren't just moving randomly—they were forming something. A structure. A *shape* that seemed to shimmer at the edges of perception, existing partially outside normal reality. Like looking at a three-dimensional object through a two-dimensional window, I could only see parts of it at any given moment. But those parts suggested something vast and terrifying.

Geometric patterns that hurt to look at directly. Angles that shouldn't exist in three-dimensional space. Lines of force that connected in ways that made my head ache as my brain tried to process topology it wasn't equipped to understand.

"It's building something," I realized with growing horror. My voice came out hoarse, strained by the effort of perceiving what the Devourer was creating. "Some kind of anchor point."

"Exactly." Zephyra's voice was grim, carrying the weight of someone who'd seen this before, who knew what came next. "If it completes that structure, this tear becomes permanent. A gateway the Devourer can use to manifest fully without needing to force its way through reality's barriers each time."

"Then we seal it before it finishes," Raechelle said, power already crackling around her hands. Blood magic manifested as crimson lightning that danced between her fingers, eager and hungry for release. Through our bond, I felt her determination—the absolute refusal to accept defeat that had defined her since the day we met. "The three of us together—"

"Won't be enough," I interrupted, hating the words even as I spoke them. Hating that I had to be the voice of restraint when every instinct screamed at me to throw myself at the problem with maximum force and damn the consequences. But I'd learned the hard way over the past three days that brute force wasn't always the answer. Sometimes, probably didn't trump always, and always didn't care about moral high ground.

"Look at the scale of this thing." I gestured toward the fifty-foot tear, toward the tendrils that numbered in the dozens and moved with terrifying coordination. "We'd need..." I trailed off, doing rapid calculations based on what Zephyra had taught me about reality manipulation. The math was complex, involving power coefficients and resonance harmonics and about six other variables that made my head hurt. But the conclusion was inescapable. "We'd need at least a dozen powerful magic users working in coordination to seal something this size."

The silence that followed my pronouncement was heavy with implications. A dozen powerful magic users. Working together. Coordinating their efforts with the precision necessary to seal a reality tear without accidentally making it worse.

Three days ago, that would have been impossible. The supernatural factions didn't cooperate like that—not on short notice, not without extensive negotiations and political maneuvering. Vampires, werewolves, witches, and the various Archon bloodlines all operated in their own spheres of influence, jealously guarding their power and viewing cooperation as weakness.

But that was three days ago. Before the Council. Before I'd revealed myself as a Prime Archon and made the existential threat visible to everyone who mattered.

"Then call them," Viktor said simply, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. "You're the Balance. You coordinated the Council. Use that political capital."

He made it sound so simple. But three days ago, I'd stood before that same Council and revealed myself as a Prime Archon—a being many of them feared and some wanted dead. Political capital was in short supply right now.

*Political capital,* I thought with dark amusement. *What a sterile way to describe the fact that half the Council thinks I'm a ticking time bomb and the other half is trying to decide whether to assassinate me preemptively or wait to see if the Devourer does the job for them.*

Lady Seraphina had made her position clear: conditional cooperation contingent on me not becoming "a greater threat than the thing I'm supposedly protecting us from." Corvinus was cautiously supportive, but his support came with the understanding that our alliance was pragmatic, not personal. The lesser Archon families were split between those who saw me as salvation and those who saw me as damnation.

And yet. Viktor was right. We didn't have a choice.

I pulled out my phone and started making calls.

*This is what leadership looks like,* I told myself as I scrolled through contacts, trying to decide who to call first. *Not grand speeches or brilliant strategies. Just a guy with a phone, begging people who barely trust him to risk their lives for the thousandth time because the alternative is oblivion.*

The first call went to Morgana. She answered on the second ring, her voice sharp with alertness despite the early hour.

"Northern breach?" she asked without preamble.

"Large one. Building an anchor structure. I need your coven."

A pause. I could hear her mental calculations, weighing risks and benefits with the cold pragmatism that made her such an effective leader. "My people are exhausted from the last three days. If I bring them to this fight—"

"People will die if you don't," I interrupted. Not manipulating, just stating fact. "Including my people. Including yours if this spreads. I'm not asking you to sacrifice your coven, Morgana. I'm asking you to help me save everyone."

Another pause, longer this time. Then: "Give me twenty minutes. I'll bring everyone who can still channel."

The call ended. One down.

Corvinus was next. He listened to my explanation with the patience of someone who'd lived through centuries of crises, then agreed with minimal argument. "I'll bring specialists in blood magic. They can help stabilize the reality matrix while you and Zephyra handle the actual sealing."

Two down.

Lady Seraphina made me work for it. Ten minutes of verbal sparring, of her questioning my judgment and leadership, of her demanding guarantees I couldn't possibly give. But ultimately, she agreed. Not because she trusted me, I suspected, but because even she recognized that extinction wasn't negotiable.

Three down, and I had commitments from most of the major players. My hand was shaking slightly as I made the remaining calls—not from fear, but from the realization of what I was orchestrating. This wasn't just a coordinated response. This was unity on a scale the supernatural community hadn't seen in generations.

*All it took was the end of the world,* I thought with bitter humor. *Nothing brings people together like mutual annihilation.*

---

Within thirty minutes, we had assembled what would have been impossible just weeks ago—a coordinated response team from multiple supernatural factions working together.

The northern territories had transformed from a battlefield into something resembling a military staging ground. Morgana arrived first, her contingent of witches materializing through teleportation circles that left scorch marks on the already-damaged ground. I counted fifteen witches total, ranging from young apprentices barely out of their teens to ancient crones who'd been practicing magic since before I was born. They moved with practiced efficiency, immediately beginning to establish ritual circles that could channel and focus magical energy.

The circles were things of beauty despite the desperate circumstances of their creation. Morgana's witches worked in synchronized harmony, one group laying down physical markers while another followed behind weaving power into patterns that glowed with soft light. Salt and ash formed the outer boundaries, while precious metals—silver and gold and more exotic elements I couldn't identify—created intricate geometric patterns within. Crystals were placed at key intersection points, each one selected for its specific resonance properties.

I watched with fascination as the magic took shape, seeing layers of power stack on top of each other like transparent sheets building toward solidity. This was craft in its purest form—not raw power flung at a problem, but careful, deliberate workings that created structures capable of channeling forces far beyond what any individual could wield.

Corvinus brought vampire specialists in blood magic who could sense and manipulate the life-force energies that reality itself was built upon. His people moved like shadows despite the chaos, finding positions where the ley lines ran strongest and embedding themselves there like anchors. I felt their presence as much as saw it—cold points of concentrated will, drawing power from the ambient life-force and preparing to redirect it when needed.

Lady Seraphina Darkthorne showed up with her personal guard—six vampires who radiated power like miniature suns, each one carefully selected for their combat prowess and magical aptitude. They weren't here out of loyalty to me, I suspected, but because even she recognized the existential threat this represented. Seraphina herself positioned near Viktor's command post, her calculating gaze taking in the tactical situation with the efficiency of someone who'd commanded armies in centuries past.

And surprisingly, Elena insisted on coming.

She materialized out of a blood-gate with the confidence of someone who'd been practicing that particular technique far more than I'd authorized. The gate itself was impressively stable—a vertical disc of crimson energy that sliced reality like a knife through cloth, allowing instantaneous travel between two points. It collapsed behind her with barely a ripple, the kind of clean closure that took most Blood Archons decades to master.

*When did she get that good?* I wondered with a mix of pride and concern.

"Absolutely not," I told her firmly as she materialized beside me through a blood-gate she'd clearly mastered despite my explicit instructions to stay at the estate. Three days of crisis preparation had apparently included some advanced training I hadn't supervised. My voice came out harder than I intended, but the fear underlying it was very real. "This is too dangerous."

Elena's jaw set in that stubborn expression that was pure Raechelle. Fifteen years old and already she had that look perfected—the one that said arguing was pointless because she'd already made up her mind and nothing short of physical restraint would change it.

"Everything is too dangerous now," she shot back, her voice carrying a certainty that made her sound older than her years. "You said yourself—we need every capable magic user. I'm a Blood Archon. I'm capable."

She wasn't wrong. Over the past three days, I'd watched Elena grow in power and confidence at a rate that should have been impossible. Maybe it was the bloodline asserting itself, or maybe it was pure necessity forcing her to rise to challenges that would have broken most people her age. Either way, she was capable. That was precisely what terrified me.

"You're also my daughter, and I won't risk—"

"You don't get to make that choice anymore," Elena interrupted, and the steel in her voice stopped me cold. Not teenage rebellion, but genuine conviction backed by logic I couldn't easily dismiss. "Not when reality itself is at stake. Not when people are dying because we don't have enough power to seal these breaches fast enough. You taught me to fight. You trained me to use my abilities. Now let me use them."

I wanted to argue. Every paternal instinct screamed at me to protect her, to send her somewhere safe, to shield her from the horrors that the Devourer represented. To preserve what little remained of her childhood, even though we both knew that childhood had effectively ended the moment the universe decided I was a mistake that needed correcting.

But as I looked into her eyes—so much like Raechelle's in their fierce determination, yet carrying my own stubborn refusal to back down—I realized she was right.

She wasn't a child anymore. The world had stripped that luxury away the moment the Devourer manifested. And trying to preserve her innocence by keeping her out of this fight wouldn't save her—it would just ensure she died anyway, helpless and unprepared, when the Devourer finally consumed everything.

The realization felt like swallowing broken glass. This was the moment every parent dreaded—when you had to acknowledge that your child had grown beyond your protection, that the best you could do was trust their training and hope you'd prepared them well enough to survive.

*Marcus never had to make this choice,* I thought with bitter irony. *He died before he had children. Before he had to weigh his paternal instincts against the survival of reality itself.*

"Stay behind the primary defenders," I finally said, each word feeling like pulling teeth because accepting this meant accepting that I might watch my daughter die tonight. "Support role only—channeling power to the seal team, not engaging tendrils directly. Understood?"

"Understood." Elena's expression softened slightly, and for just a moment I saw a flash of the little girl who used to climb into my lap and demand stories about the old days before everything got complicated. "I'll be careful, Dad. I promise."

The word "Dad" hit me harder than it should have. She usually called me Riven in public, maintaining that careful distance between parental relationship and professional hierarchy that supernatural politics often demanded. Hearing "Dad" now, in this moment, was her way of saying she understood what I was sacrificing by letting her fight.

*I love you so much it terrifies me,* I wanted to say. *You're the best thing I've ever helped create, and the thought of losing you makes me want to unmake reality myself.*

But what I said instead was: "I know you will. You're your mother's daughter."

"And yours," she replied with a fierce grin, then jogged toward Morgana's ritual position before I could change my mind.

Raechelle moved beside me as Elena jogged toward Morgana's ritual position, our bond humming with shared anxiety and reluctant pride. Through that connection, I felt her own internal struggle—the same war between protective instincts and pragmatic necessity that I was fighting. But underneath it all, a fierce pride in the young woman our daughter was becoming.

"She reminds me of you," Raechelle murmured, her hand finding mine and squeezing gently. "Stubborn. Brave. Unwilling to hide while others fight."

"She reminds me of you," I countered, squeezing back with just enough pressure to convey things I didn't have words for. "Fierce. Protective of those she cares about. Stronger than anyone realizes."

"Then she's got the best of both of us," Raechelle said, her voice carrying a certainty I wished I could share. "Now let's make sure she has a world to grow up in."

She released my hand and moved to join Lady Seraphina's defensive positions, her blades already drawn and blood magic crackling between her fingertips. I watched her go, drawing strength from her unwavering determination, using it to shore up my own crumbling resolve.

*We can do this,* I told myself with more conviction than I felt. *We have the power, we have the people, and we have a plan. That has to be enough. It has to be, because the alternative is unthinkable.*

---

The coordinated sealing attempt was unlike anything I'd ever attempted.

The sheer scale of what we were attempting hit me as I moved into position. This wasn't a simple barrier spell or a quick patch job on a minor reality tear. This was fundamental magic, the kind of working that required precise synchronization between dozens of individuals, each one channeling their particular specialty into a unified whole. One person out of sync, one momentary lapse in concentration, and the entire structure could collapse—possibly taking all of us with it.

*No pressure,* I thought with dark humor as I felt the weight of everyone's expectations settling onto my shoulders like a physical burden.

Zephyra and I positioned ourselves at the primary anchor points of the reality tear, serving as the main channels for the sealing magic. She took the northern position, I took the southern, creating a line of force between us that would serve as the spine of the sealing structure. The distance between us—perhaps two hundred feet—felt like miles as I settled into my position and began drawing power from my five affinities.

Blood magic came first, rising up from the core of who I was. It pulsed in time with my heartbeat, familiar and comfortable, the affinity I'd known longest and understood best. Ice followed, crystallizing in my veins and bringing clarity to my thoughts. Shadow wrapped around me like armor, fire kindled in my chest, and lightning crackled through my nervous system with electric awareness.

All five affinities active simultaneously. Even after three days of training, the sensation was overwhelming—like trying to think in five different languages at once while solving complex mathematics in each one. My body wasn't designed for this kind of multitasking. None of our bodies were. Prime Archon power was evolution pushed beyond reasonable limits, forcing human physiology to channel forces that should have torn us apart.

*But Marcus did this for decades,* I reminded myself. *And if he could master it, so can I. Assuming I don't explode first.*

Morgana's witches formed an outer circle around us, their ritual magic providing structure and framework. I could feel their power weaving together, creating a lattice work of focused intent that would help stabilize our working. Each witch contributed their specialty—elemental magic, binding spells, protective wards—all of it flowing together like instruments in an orchestra building toward crescendo.

Corvinus's vampire specialists connected to the deeper currents of life-energy that flowed through reality itself. They didn't channel power so much as redirect it, finding the natural flows and bending them toward our purpose. It was subtle work, requiring incredible sensitivity and control. Too much pressure and they'd dam the flow entirely. Too little and it would slip through their grasp. But they performed with the confidence of centuries of practice, becoming living conduits for forces older than civilization.

Lady Seraphina's guard maintained defensive positions, ready to intercept any tendrils that broke through our concentration. They spread out in a loose perimeter, weapons drawn, eyes fixed on the writhing void-energies with the wary alertness of experienced warriors. I saw one of them—a tall female vampire with silver hair and scars that suggested she'd survived things that should have killed her multiple times—gesture to her companions, organizing them into mutually supporting positions where each one could cover another's blind spots.

And Elena, along with several other young Archons, formed a supporting network—channeling raw power to those of us doing the actual sealing work. I felt her presence at the edge of my awareness, steady and strong despite her youth. She'd positioned herself within Morgana's primary circle, standing at one of the key power nodes where ley lines intersected. Smart positioning—close enough to the main working to contribute meaningfully, but with multiple layers of protection between her and the reality tear.

*That's my girl,* I thought with fierce pride. *Brave but not stupid. Willing to fight but smart enough to recognize her limitations.*

"On my mark," Zephyra called out, her voice carrying with supernatural clarity to every person present. The sound bypassed normal hearing entirely, projecting directly into our minds with absolute precision. Not telepathy exactly, but something close—a technique she'd explained involved resonating with the ley lines themselves to carry meaning directly to anyone connected to them. "We all push together. If anyone breaks concentration, the backlash could kill us all. Understood?"

A chorus of acknowledgments rippled through the assembled defenders. Some verbal, some mental, some expressed through the magical connections we'd established. But the message was clear: we were committed. All or nothing. Win or die trying.

*No other option,* I thought, feeling the weight of that truth settle into my bones. *This is what leadership means. Not inspiring speeches or grand gestures. Just standing at the focal point of reality-altering magic and trusting that everyone else will do their part while you do yours.*

"Three... two... one... NOW!"

Power surged through me like nothing I'd ever felt—not just my own Prime Archon abilities, but the combined might of dozens of supernatural beings all channeling their magic through me as a focal point. It was overwhelming, exhilarating, and terrifying all at once.

My blood ignited, literally boiling in my veins with power that should have killed me instantly. Ice formed to cool it, creating a thermal balance that was probably violating every known law of thermodynamics. Shadow absorbed the overflow, compressing excess energy into dimensional spaces that shouldn't exist. Fire metabolized what couldn't be absorbed, and lightning coordinated it all, keeping the disparate elements from tearing me apart through their conflicting natures.

And through it all, I could feel Elena's contribution—a steady stream of power that tasted like blood and determination, flavored with just a hint of fear that she was trying to hide. My daughter was feeding me magic while I stood at ground zero of a reality-altering working that could kill us all if it went wrong.

*Focus,* I commanded myself savagely. *Fear later. Emotional breakdown later. Right now, seal the damn breach.*

I thrust that power toward the reality tear, feeling Zephyra doing the same from her position. Our energies met in the center of the breach, weaving together with the practiced synchronization we'd developed over the past three days of training. It felt like threading a needle while skydiving—precision work requiring absolute concentration despite the chaos surrounding us.

But we'd practiced this. Drilled it until the movements were muscle memory, until our powers knew how to interlock without conscious direction. Blood magic from me met Zephyra's fire, creating steam that solidified into barriers. My ice reinforced her earth, forming crystalline structures that resisted void-energy. Shadow and light cancelled each other out in carefully controlled annihilations that released massive amounts of binding energy.

The Devourer noticed immediately.

The tendrils whipped toward us with sudden, vicious intent. No longer focused on building their anchor structure, they attacked with the singular purpose of disrupting our concentration. The change in behavior was immediate and terrifying—from methodical construction to frenzied assault in the space of a heartbeat.

*It's adapting,* I realized with cold dread. *Just like Zephyra warned. It learned from Council Square that we could seal breaches if given time. So now it's prioritizing disruption over completion.*

Dozens of tendrils broke off from the main mass, each one targeting a different member of our defensive formation. They moved with horrifying speed, crossing distances that should have taken seconds in fractional moments. I felt Lady Seraphina's guards engage them, heard Viktor's werewolves howling battle cries as they intercepted the ones that broke through the first defensive line.

The clash of supernatural power against void-energy created soundscapes from nightmares. Claws raking across non-existence produced sounds like tearing silk mixed with breaking glass. Magic impacts resonated like bells cast from solidified screams. Werewolf battle cries dopplered strangely, as if the very air around the tendrils couldn't decide whether to carry sound properly or simply give up and stop existing.

One of Seraphina's guards—the silver-haired vampire I'd noticed earlier—met a tendril head-on with a sword that gleamed with enchantments older than most nations. Her blade carved through void-energy, leaving trails of disruption that glowed like reverse-lightning. But the tendril reformed, adapting its structure to resist her weapon. She adapted in turn, changing her strike patterns, forcing it to continuously evolve its defenses.

It was buying us time. Seconds, maybe a minute if we were lucky. But it was enough.

Viktor's werewolves formed a living wall, massive hybrid forms using their bodies to intercept tendrils that slipped through the primary defenses. I saw Marcus—Viktor's second—back in the fight despite his earlier injuries, his regeneration having done enough to get him mobile again if not fully healed. He roared defiance as he caught a tendril in both massive paws, his enhanced strength arresting its momentum even as void-energy seared his flesh.

But some got through anyway.

A tendril materialized beside Morgana's ritual circle, moving faster than should have been possible. It must have pushed through reality at a different angle, bypassing our defenses by simply existing in a space where they weren't. The tactic was brilliant and terrifying, suggesting an intelligence that could analyze our formation and identify weak points in real-time.

It lashed out toward the witches—toward Elena, I realized with sudden horror—and in that frozen instant, I had to make an impossible choice.

Break concentration to save my daughter, and doom everyone here.

Or trust her training and keep sealing the breach.

The choice should have been impossible. Every instinct, every fiber of my being screamed at me to abandon the working and protect Elena. She was my daughter, my child, the person I loved more than life itself. How could I possibly prioritize anything—even reality itself—over her safety?

*But if I break concentration now,* the cold tactical part of my mind whispered, *the backlash kills everyone. Including Elena. Including Raechelle. Including every person who's risked their life because they trusted me to lead them through this.*

Seconds. I had seconds to make this choice. Maybe not even that—fractions of a second, slivers of time measured in heartbeats and the speed of nerve impulses.

*Trust her,* Raechelle's voice echoed through our bond, steady despite the fear I felt mirroring my own. Her presence in my mind was a lifeline, an anchor of certainty in a moment of impossible decision. *She's ready.*

The words gave me the strength I needed. Not to be callous, not to value the mission over my daughter's life. But to recognize that Elena was capable, that I'd trained her for exactly this kind of situation, and that trusting her meant giving her the space to prove herself even when it terrified me.

*Gods, please let me be right about this,* I prayed to deities I wasn't sure existed.

Elena saw the tendril coming. Instead of freezing or panicking, she reacted with the instincts I'd drilled into her through years of training. Years of combat practice that had seemed excessive at the time, lessons that had made her complain about why she needed to know how to defend herself when she was "just" an Archon heir.

This. This was why.

Her hands came up, blood magic flaring to life in a defensive shield that caught the tendril's strike and deflected it away from the ritual circle. The construct was textbook perfect—three-layer defense with reinforced anchor points, exactly as I'd taught her. The outer layer absorbed kinetic impact, the middle layer disrupted void-energy, and the inner layer provided structural integrity in case the first two failed.

The impact drove her to one knee, blood trickling from her nose from the strain of channeling so much power so quickly. I felt the feedback through our blood connection—the sheer force of the tendril's assault, the desperate effort required to hold the shield, the pain of pushing her magic beyond comfortable limits.

But the shield held. And more importantly, she kept channeling power to the sealing effort even as she maintained her defense.

The sheer mental discipline that required made my chest tight with emotion I couldn't afford to feel right now. She was defending against a reality-consuming entity with one hand while feeding power to our sealing working with the other, multitasking in ways that most magic users wouldn't attempt even without the threat of instant death hanging over them.

Pride surged through me so intensely that I almost lost my own concentration. That was my daughter. Stubborn, brave, and strong enough to hold her ground against cosmic horror while maintaining her part in a coordinated magical working that was already straining her to her limits.

"Focus, Riven!" Zephyra's sharp command snapped me back to the task at hand.

Right. Save reality first, have emotional moment about daughter's bravery later.

I redoubled my efforts, weaving reality back together thread by thread. The Devourer fought us every step of the way—its intelligence apparent in how it targeted the weakest points of our seal, how it adapted its attacks to exploit the slightest gap in our coordination.

When we reinforced one section, it attacked another. When we distributed our power evenly, it concentrated its assault on a single point. When we tried to match its concentration, it switched to distributed attacks. It was like playing chess against an opponent who could see the entire board and calculate probabilities faster than we could react.

But we were learning too. Each encounter taught us more about how it operated, what it could and couldn't do, where its limitations lay. And slowly, agonizingly, we began to win.

I noticed patterns in its attack rhythms—slight delays when it had to reform tendrils that were destroyed, hesitation when it encountered defenses it hadn't seen before. Those patterns became vulnerabilities. Morgana's witches adjusted their ritual structures to exploit the delays. Viktor's werewolves timed their attacks to coincide with the hesitations. Corvinus's vampires redirected life-force flows to starve the tendrils of energy when they reformed.

The reality tear started to close. Not quickly—this wasn't like Council Square where Zephyra and I had sealed it in minutes. This took sustained effort from everyone present, a grinding battle of wills between us and the void.

Twenty minutes passed. My muscles screamed from the strain of channeling so much power. I felt several of the supporting channelers drop out, exhausted beyond their limits. But others took their places, rotating through so the power flow never completely dropped. Morgana had organized them into shifts without me even asking, her tactical mind recognizing the need for sustainability over heroic overextension.

Thirty minutes. The tear was now visibly smaller, its edges pulling inward as reality reasserted itself. The Devourer's tendrils lashed out with increasing desperation, but they were weakening—unable to maintain their presence in our reality without the stable gateway.

Forty minutes. The tear was half-closed now, the anchor structure the Devourer had been building crumbling under our assault. Each piece that fell away made our job easier, reducing the amount of void-energy we had to contain. I could feel the momentum shifting, the balance of power tipping in our favor.

But gods, the cost. I felt it in my body—muscles torn from the strain of channeling, blood vessels burst from the pressure, organs struggling to process energies they weren't designed to handle. Only my enhanced healing kept me functional, repairing damage as fast as it occurred. And I knew everyone else was suffering similarly, pushing themselves beyond safe limits because the alternative was extinction.

*Just a little longer,* I thought through gritted teeth. *We can break down later. Right now, finish this.*

"Almost there," Zephyra called out, though I heard the strain in her voice. Even three thousand years of experience couldn't make this easy. The sheer amount of power we were channeling would have killed a normal person a hundred times over. Even for Prime Archons, this was pushing limits that probably shouldn't be pushed. "One final push—everyone together!"

We gave it everything we had left. Every ounce of power, every fragment of will, every desperate hope that we could actually win this fight. I felt Elena's contribution surge—a final burst of strength from a teenager who refused to quit even when her body was begging her to stop. Felt Morgana's witches consolidate their power, transforming from fifteen individual sources into a single unified force. Felt Corvinus's vampires redirect one massive pulse of life-energy, borrowing from the land itself to fuel this final assault.

The reality tear collapsed inward with a sound like shattering glass mixed with a dying scream, and then—

Silence.

The breach was sealed. Reality reasserted itself with an almost audible snap, the natural order reimposing itself where the Devourer had tried to unmake it. The temperature stabilized, the air tasted normal again, and the oppressive weight of void-energy lifted like fog burning away under morning sun.

For a moment, just a moment, we'd won.

And then people started collapsing.

---

The aftermath was exhausting in a way that pure combat never was.

Morgana's witches were drained to the point of unconsciousness, their ritual magic having burned through reserves they'd need weeks to rebuild. I watched them fall where they stood, bodies simply giving up once the adrenaline faded. Several of the younger ones were bleeding from their eyes and ears—pushed past safe limits into territory where permanent damage became likely. The older witches looked decades older, their magic having literally aged them as it consumed resources their bodies couldn't afford to give.

Morgana herself remained standing, but only through sheer force of will. Her hands shook visibly, and I could see the tremors in her legs as she fought to remain upright. She was organizing triage with clipped commands, directing those witches who could still move to tend to those who couldn't, but her voice had lost its usual sharp authority.

Corvinus's vampires weren't much better—their life-energy manipulation had cost them dearly, leaving several in a weakened state that would take days of feeding to recover from. One of his specialists had actually aged visibly, grey hair showing at his temples where there had been none before. The price of channeling that much life-force was having it stripped from your own reserves when you ran out of external sources.

Viktor's werewolves were scattered around the perimeter, many of them reverted to human form as their bodies gave up on maintaining the energy-intensive hybrid shapes. I counted wounded—too many wounded. Burns from void-energy exposure, broken bones from tendril impacts, deep lacerations from close combat. Their enhanced healing would handle most of it eventually, but right now they looked like an army that had fought a war and barely survived.

Lady Seraphina's guard had suffered the least, their defensive role meaning they'd spent power on combat rather than reality manipulation. But even they showed signs of exhaustion—weapons lowered, postures relaxed from battle-ready tension, the thousand-yard stare of people who'd seen things they couldn't quite process yet.

Elena was on her feet, but barely. The combined effort of maintaining her shield and channeling power to the seal had pushed her past her limits. Her face was pale as death, blood crusted under her nose and at the corners of her eyes, and she swayed as if a strong breeze might knock her over. But there was fierce pride shining in her exhausted eyes, a determination that hadn't dimmed despite her body's protests.

Raechelle caught her as she stumbled, and I rushed over to find my daughter pale but alive, that fierce pride still burning despite the exhaustion that clearly had her moments from collapse.

"I held," she whispered, her voice barely audible but carrying absolute conviction. "I didn't break."

"You did more than hold," I told her, brushing bloodstained hair from her face with hands that shook from my own exhaustion. "You saved lives. You proved yourself worthy of being called an Archon."

The words felt inadequate. How did you tell your daughter that you'd watched her face down a cosmic horror and felt both terrified and proud in equal measure? How did you express that she'd exceeded every expectation while simultaneously confirming every fear?

"Worth it," she mumbled, then promptly passed out in Raechelle's arms.

Raechelle cradled Elena against her chest, and through our bond I felt her own complex swirl of emotions—relief that Elena was alive, pride that she'd proven herself, guilt that we'd put her in danger, and underneath it all, a bone-deep exhaustion that matched my own.

"She'll be fine," Raechelle said quietly, though I couldn't tell if she was reassuring me or herself. "She just needs rest. And probably a week of sleep and about fifty heavy meals. But she'll be fine."

I wanted to believe that. Needed to believe it. But I'd seen too many magic users push too hard and suffer permanent consequences. Burns that never healed properly, channels damaged beyond repair, minds fractured by strain they weren't ready to handle.

*Please let her be fine,* I prayed. *She's earned that much.*

Viktor approached, his massive werewolf form somehow looking smaller after the battle. Blood still matted his fur, and I could see he was favoring his left side where one of the tendrils had gotten through his defenses. The wound looked serious—deep enough that I could see bone through the torn flesh, though his regeneration was already working to close it. But healing took energy, and energy was something all of us were running dangerously low on.

"Final count?" I asked, dreading the answer but needing to know. As the leader, as the person who'd called everyone here, I owed it to the dead to at least acknowledge the price of our victory.

Viktor's ears flattened against his skull—a gesture of grief in werewolf body language. "Five confirmed dead," he reported grimly, his voice rougher than usual. Maybe from the strain of battle, maybe from the emotional weight of the losses. "Two of mine, three civilians who were too close when the tear opened. Nineteen seriously wounded—and I mean seriously, the kind where full recovery isn't guaranteed even with supernatural healing. That includes the two scouts who were erased entirely at the beginning—seven total casualties if you count complete erasure as death, which I damn well do."

Seven dead. Five bodies to bury, and two people who simply ceased to exist. Two individuals who'd been erased so completely that reality itself had forgotten they'd ever been. Their families wouldn't just lose them—they'd lose the memories, the photographs, the evidence that they'd ever existed. In a few days, even the grief would fade, because how do you mourn someone you can't remember?

*That's the truly horrifying part,* I realized. *Not just that they died, but that they were unmade so thoroughly that even their deaths don't really register. They didn't die fighting. They just... stopped being.*

For what we'd been fighting, it could have been so much worse. I knew that intellectually. A reality tear of this magnitude hitting a populated area without warning could have killed hundreds. The fact that we'd limited it to seven casualties was, in purely strategic terms, a victory.

But each death was still a weight on my conscience—people who died because the universe itself was trying to correct the paradox of my existence. Seven individuals with families, friends, lives they'd been living before I became a Prime Archon and painted a target on everyone in my territories.

*How many more will die before this is over?* I wondered, not for the first time and certainly not for the last.

"We'll honor them," I said quietly, the words feeling hollow but necessary. "Make sure their families are taken care of. Full compensation, supernatural protections, whatever they need. Their sacrifice won't be forgotten."

Even as I said it, I knew it wasn't enough. Money and protections couldn't bring back the dead. Couldn't restore the two who'd been erased so completely that their families would soon forget they'd ever existed. But it was all I could offer, and offering nothing would be worse.

"Already arranged," Viktor said, and I felt a surge of gratitude for his practical efficiency. "Pension funds set up, protected housing assigned, priority access to pack resources for life. And Riven..." He paused, choosing his words carefully. "My people knew the risks. They chose to fight anyway. Their deaths aren't on your conscience—they're on the Devourer's. Don't dishonor their choice by assuming they were victims rather than warriors."

The words hit harder than they should have. Viktor was right—treating the dead as helpless victims diminished the agency they'd had, the choices they'd made. They'd been warriors who'd assessed the risks and decided some things were worth dying for.

But that didn't make it hurt less.

"Still," I said, my voice coming out rougher than intended. "We need to find a way to prevent this from happening again. We can't keep trading lives every time the Devourer decides to probe our defenses."

"But Riven... this was just one tear. What happens when the Devourer attacks multiple locations simultaneously?" Viktor's question cut to the heart of my fears. "We barely had enough power to seal this breach. If it splits our attention—"

"I know." The strategic implications were already churning through my mind like gears grinding against each other. "We need more than just rapid response. We need a way to predict where it will attack next, or better yet, prevent the attacks entirely."

"How do you prevent something that exists outside normal reality?" Lady Seraphina had approached without me noticing, her movement as silent as only an ancient vampire could achieve. Her expression was thoughtful rather than hostile for once, those calculating eyes taking in the aftermath with the detachment of someone who'd seen battlefields before. "I'll admit, Riven, your coordination here was impressive. But even I can see the mathematics of attrition. The Devourer can attempt as many breaches as it wants. We have limited defenders and even more limited energy reserves. Eventually, something will slip through our defenses."

She wasn't wrong. The thought of facing multiple breaches simultaneously made my blood run cold. Today's battle had required every resource we could muster—every magic user within quick response range, every defender who could channel power or hold a line. If the Devourer had opened even one more tear at the same time, we'd have had to choose which one to seal first. And the other would have claimed countless lives while we fought elsewhere.

*And it will figure that out eventually,* I thought with grim certainty. *It's learning, adapting. How long before it realizes that dividing our forces is the key to victory? How long before it opens five tears at once, or ten, and forces us to watch as half our territories get consumed while we desperately try to save the other half?*

"Then we need to change the equation," I said, an idea beginning to form in the back of my mind. Still nebulous, not quite solid enough to articulate, but present. "Zephyra, you said the Devourer targets confluence points—places where ley lines intersect. Can we... shield them somehow? Create barriers that prevent it from manifesting there in the first place?"

Zephyra materialized beside us, her earlier battle fatigue hidden behind renewed focus. I'd learned over the past three days that she recovered faster than any being I'd ever met—three thousand years of practice at managing her energy reserves, probably. "In theory, yes. We'd need to establish magical wards at every major confluence point in your territories. But that's hundreds of locations, and the power required to maintain those wards continuously..."

"Would drain our resources even faster than responding to attacks," Corvinus finished, having joined our impromptu strategy session along with the other major players. His presence was like a cold wind, ancient power barely constrained by civilized appearance. "We'd be spreading ourselves so thin that any breach that *did* occur would find us with no power left to seal it."

I wanted to scream in frustration. Every solution we considered came with impossible trade-offs. React to attacks and exhaust ourselves through attrition. Shield everywhere and weaken ourselves proactively. It felt like being in a chess game where every move left us more vulnerable, where the only winning strategy was not to play—except that not playing meant extinction.

*There has to be another option,* I thought desperately. *Something we aren't seeing. Some angle that hasn't occurred to us yet.*

My phone buzzed with an incoming call. Morgana's name flashed on the screen, pulling me out of my spiraling strategic thoughts.

"How are you even conscious enough to make calls?" I answered, knowing she'd been among the most drained after the ritual work. I'd watched her witches collapse, seen the toll that channeling so much power had taken on all of them. Morgana herself had looked ready to drop when I'd last checked on her.

"Stimulant potion and spite," she replied, her voice rough but alert with the sharp focus that only chemical enhancement could provide after that level of exhaustion. I could hear the edge in her tone—the brittleness that came from pushing past your body's warnings and operating on borrowed time. "Listen, I've been going through the texts I recovered about reality-consuming entities. There's something I think you need to see. Something that might explain why the Devourer is behaving the way it is."

My exhaustion-fogged brain tried to process that. Morgana had been researching during the three days since the Council revelation, diving into texts and archives that most magic users either didn't have access to or didn't dare consult. Dangerous knowledge, the kind that came with prices and risks. But if she'd found something...

"Can it wait?" I asked, even though I already knew the answer. "We're dealing with aftermath here, and people need—"

"No, it can't wait," Morgana interrupted firmly, steel in her voice cutting through my exhaustion-induced prioritization. "Because if I'm right, the Devourer isn't just trying to unmake reality or consume your power. It's following a specific pattern. And that pattern suggests it has a primary objective we haven't identified yet."

That got everyone's attention. Lady Seraphina leaned in closer, her calculating expression sharpening into focus. Viktor's ears perked forward, battle-weariness momentarily forgotten. Zephyra's ancient eyes fixed on the phone with sudden intensity. Even Corvinus, who'd been directing his vampires to help with triage, turned toward us.

*A specific objective.* Not random attacks, not mere reaction to my existence. Purpose. Intent. Strategy.

"What kind of objective?" I asked carefully, aware that everyone was listening now.

"That's the problem—I'm not certain yet. But Riven, every documented case of reality-consuming entities shows them pursuing a specific goal. They don't just attack randomly. They're looking for something, or trying to achieve something. And once I know what that is..."

"We can predict its actions," I finished, feeling hope kindle in my chest for the first time since this whole crisis began. "Maybe even get ahead of it instead of constantly reacting."

Being reactive was killing us—literally. Every response drained our resources, exhausted our defenders, claimed lives. But if we could anticipate the Devourer's moves, if we could position ourselves before it attacked rather than scrambling after...

That changed everything.

"Exactly. Come to my sanctum as soon as you can. Bring Zephyra—I need her historical perspective on some of these references. And..." She paused, and I heard her mental calculation, the weighing of necessity against preference. "Bring Lady Seraphina too. Some of these texts reference vampire archives that Corvinus doesn't have access to. If we're going to solve this puzzle, we need every piece of information available."

The fact that Morgana was willing to include Seraphina spoke volumes. The two of them had what could politely be called a professional rivalry and more honestly be described as barely-contained hostility. Morgana viewed Seraphina as a political manipulator who valued power over principle. Seraphina considered Morgana a dangerous radical whose research ventured into territories best left alone.

But apparently, impending doom made strange bedfellows.

After hanging up, I found myself looking at the assembled group—former rivals and uneasy allies united by necessity against an existential threat. Viktor, loyal to a fault, his pack having bled for my cause without hesitation. Corvinus, ancient and wise, bringing three thousand years of vampire knowledge to bear on an unprecedented crisis. Lady Seraphina, calculating but pragmatic, willing to work with people she distrusted because the alternative was extinction. Zephyra, woman out of time carrying the weight of millennia and the guilt of her lost world. Morgana, brilliant and determined, pushing herself past human limits in pursuit of answers.

And Raechelle, holding our unconscious daughter, her eyes meeting mine with perfect understanding. My partner, my anchor, the person who kept me grounded when the weight of responsibility threatened to crush me.

*This is what we've built,* I realized. *Not an army, not a hierarchy. A coalition of the unwilling, forced together by circumstances none of us wanted. And somehow, we're making it work.*

We were fighting something that shouldn't exist against odds that no rational person would accept. But we were doing it together. And somehow, that had to be enough.

"All right," I said, straightening despite my exhaustion. My body protested—every muscle ached, my magical reserves felt scraped raw, and I was pretty sure I had internal bleeding that my healing factor was still working to repair. But none of that mattered. "Let's figure out what this thing actually wants. Because if we understand its objective, we can stop reacting and start taking the fight to it."

---

Morgana's sanctum was exactly what you'd expect from a powerful witch—a converted warehouse in the industrial district filled with books, artifacts, and magical instruments that hummed with latent power.

The building itself was nondescript from the outside—weathered red brick, high windows that revealed nothing of the interior, a loading dock that hadn't seen legitimate commercial use in decades. Perfect camouflage in a district full of similar structures. But the moment we stepped through the entrance, the mundane facade fell away.

The walls were covered in protective wards so dense they made my eyes water to look at directly. Not simple protection spells, but layered defenses that formed an almost solid barrier of interwoven magic. I recognized some of the patterns from texts I'd studied—binding circles to trap hostile entities, reflection matrices to turn attacks back on their source, dampening fields that would suppress any unauthorized magic use. But others were completely foreign, suggesting Morgana had either invented her own techniques or was drawing from traditions I didn't know existed.

The air itself tasted of old magic and older secrets. Not unpleasant exactly, but heavy—like breathing in a library full of ancient manuscripts while someone burned incense in the next room. Ozone from active spellwork mixed with the musty scent of preserved materials and something else, something that my brain categorized as the smell of possibility itself. The temperature was precisely controlled, neither warm nor cold, maintained at whatever level best preserved her collection.

She'd spread out her findings across a massive central table—ancient texts, modern research notes, and arcane diagrams that seemed to shift when I wasn't looking directly at them. The texts ranged from leather-bound tomes that looked like they predated the printing press to laser-printed documents still warm from the printer. Maps covered one section of the table, some of them depicting territories that no longer existed, marked with symbols I couldn't decipher. Crystals and other focus items were positioned at seemingly random points, though I suspected the arrangement had purpose I wasn't seeing.

Morgana herself looked like death warmed over despite the stimulant potions. Her eyes were bloodshot, dark circles underneath suggesting she hadn't slept since the battle. Her hands trembled slightly as she arranged documents, and I noticed she was leaning heavily on the table for support. But her mind was clearly razor-sharp, organizing information with the efficiency of someone running on pure intellectual adrenaline.

"All right," Morgana began without preamble once we'd all assembled. No pleasantries, no small talk—straight to business. I appreciated that about her. "I've cross-referenced every documented encounter with reality-consuming entities over the past six thousand years. There are seventeen confirmed cases. In fourteen of them, the entity was successfully defeated or sealed. In two cases, they achieved their objective and departed. In one case..." She paused, her expression darkening in a way that made my stomach clench. "The entity won completely. An entire civilization was unmade so thoroughly that we only know they existed through second-hand references in other cultures' texts."

The silence that followed was heavy with implications. An entire civilization erased. Not conquered, not destroyed—erased. As if they'd never been. And the only reason we even knew it had happened was because neighboring cultures had mentioned them in passing before they were unmade.

*That's what we're fighting,* I thought with cold certainty. *Not an enemy we can negotiate with or appease. Something that will unmake us so completely that even the memory of our existence will be questionable.*

"Cheerful," Viktor muttered, his dark humor a coping mechanism I understood all too well.

"But informative," Zephyra said, leaning forward to study the documents with an intensity that suggested personal interest. Three thousand years ago, she'd lived through her own apocalypse. This wasn't academic for her—it was trauma made relevant again. "Because you said it—in two cases, the entities achieved their objective and left. Which means they *have* objectives. What were they?"

"That's where it gets interesting," Morgana replied, pulling forward two specific documents. One was so old that the parchment crackled with every touch, covered in script I didn't recognize. The other was relatively modern—typewritten text on yellowed paper, probably from the early twentieth century. "In both cases, the entities were after a specific magical artifact. Not to destroy it—to consume it. To absorb its power and integrate that power into their own existence."

My blood ran cold as the implications hit me. "You think the Devourer is after an artifact?"

"I think the Devourer is after *power*," Morgana corrected, tapping one of the ancient texts for emphasis. "Specifically, unique power that doesn't exist anywhere else. In those two historical cases, the artifacts were one-of-a-kind magical constructs with abilities nothing else in reality possessed. The entities consumed them not for destruction, but for evolution."

"To become permanent," Corvinus breathed, ancient understanding dawning in his eyes. "Just as you theorized after Council Square. It wants to consume something so unique that integrating it would make the Devourer a permanent fixture of reality rather than a temporary correction mechanism."

"And the only thing that qualifies in our current reality..." Lady Seraphina said slowly, her calculating gaze fixing on me and Zephyra with unsettling intensity. "Would be Prime Archon power. The rarest, most unique power source in existence."

A chill ran down my spine. Not just because she was right, but because of what it meant. The Devourer wasn't some mindless force—it had a goal, a purpose, an end state it was working toward. And that end state involved consuming the essence of what made Prime Archons unique.

*It wants to eat us and become real,* I thought with dark humor. *Like some kind of cosmic parasite elevating itself by devouring its host's specialness.*

"But there's more," Morgana continued, ignoring the sudden tension in the room. Her focus was entirely on the puzzle, on the intellectual challenge of understanding our enemy. She gestured to a map she'd created showing all the reality tears that had manifested over the past three days. "Look at the pattern of attacks."

I studied the map. Red marks indicated breach points, numbered in the order they'd occurred. The first few were scattered, almost random. But as I traced the pattern forward, I saw them converging, growing larger, following the ley lines toward...

"Council Square—seven ley lines," I noted. "The northern territories today—nine ley lines. The smaller probes you've sealed over the past three days—all between three and five ley lines."

"It's escalating," I noted. "Going after more powerful confluence points each time."

"Yes, but *why*?" Morgana challenged, her researcher's instinct pushing for deeper understanding. "If it just wanted to consume you and Zephyra, it would attack you directly. Instead, it's systematically targeting increasingly powerful magical nexus points. And if we project the pattern forward..." She traced a line on the map that made my stomach drop.

The line led directly to the Archon Spire.

Of course it did.

"Thirteen ley lines," Zephyra said quietly, her voice carrying the weight of history. She'd been there when the Spire was built, after all. Had probably helped select the location precisely because of its confluence. "The most powerful confluence point in the entire region. We already knew it would attack there for the final confrontation."

"But what if that's not why?" Morgana pressed, and I could see the excitement of discovery warring with the horror of what she'd found. "What if the Spire itself is the target? What if there's something *at* the Spire that the Devourer wants?"

Silence filled the sanctum as that implication sank in. The Spire wasn't just a symbol, wasn't just a convergence of ley lines. It was a repository. A vault. A place where the most dangerous and powerful artifacts of the Blood Archon lineage had been stored for three thousand years.

*Oh hell.*

"The Spire is ancient," Corvinus said slowly, his ancient mind processing implications that would take me minutes to fully grasp. "Built three thousand years ago by the first Blood Archons as both a monument and a..." He trailed off, realization dawning. "A repository. For knowledge, power, artifacts too dangerous to be kept elsewhere."

"What kind of artifacts?" I asked, though part of me already knew the answer. Already felt the cold certainty settling into my bones.

"Prime Archon artifacts," Zephyra confirmed, her voice hollow with memory. The words came out flat, emotionless—the way people sounded when discussing trauma they'd buried for millennia. "When Marcus died, his personal effects were sealed at the Spire. Weapons he'd forged. Techniques he'd developed. And..." She looked at me directly, and I saw ancient guilt in those ageless eyes. "His blood. A significant amount of it, preserved in stasis as a genetic archive in case future Blood Archons needed to access it."

My hand unconsciously went to Marcus's ring on my finger. The metal felt warm, as it always did, pulsing faintly in rhythm with my heartbeat. A connection across time and death, linking me to a predecessor I'd never met but whose legacy defined my existence.

"You're saying the Devourer doesn't just want to consume us. It wants to consume Marcus's preserved legacy too. Everything that made him a Prime Archon."

The horror of it was almost too vast to process. Not just killing the living Prime Archons, but consuming the dead one as well. Erasing Marcus from existence so thoroughly that even his preserved essence would be unmade.

"Think about it," Morgana said urgently, her exhaustion momentarily forgotten in the face of her discovery. "Two living Prime Archons plus the preserved essence of a third. If the Devourer could consume all three sources of Prime Archon power, it would have everything it needs to become permanent. Not just survive, but *transcend*—become something that reality itself couldn't reject anymore."

The math was terrifying in its simplicity. Marcus's preserved blood contained his genetic template, the blueprint of Prime Archon power. Zephyra carried three thousand years of accumulated knowledge and experience. I brought five affinities and whatever unique evolution my bloodline had undergone. Together, we represented everything that made Prime Archons special.

And the Devourer wanted to consume all of it.

"Which means our timeline just changed," Viktor growled, his tactical mind grasping the implications immediately. "It's not building up power for a final assault on the Spire. It's eliminating obstacles and conserving strength for one massive attack aimed at the repository. And when it makes that attack—"

"It will come with everything it has," I finished. "No holding back, no testing defenses. One overwhelming assault designed to breach the Spire's protections before we can respond."

The image was terrifying. Not the probing attacks we'd been facing, not the escalating breaches that we could barely seal with coordinated effort. A single massive assault, the Devourer throwing everything it had at the Spire while we scrambled to respond, knowing that if it succeeded even for a moment, it would consume Marcus's legacy and become unstoppable.

"How long do we have?" Raechelle asked quietly. She'd remained silent throughout the briefing, but I felt her growing concern through our bond. The protective instincts that made her such a fierce mother now focused on protecting not just our family, but everyone who depended on us.

Morgana consulted her notes, cross-referencing several texts with the kind of speed that suggested she'd already done this calculation multiple times and was just confirming her conclusions. "Based on the escalation pattern and the energy signature of today's attack... three days. Maybe four. And that's assuming it doesn't accelerate the timetable if it realizes we've figured out its objective."

Three days. Maybe four. Seventy-two to ninety-six hours to prepare for a battle that would determine whether reality itself survived. To organize defenses, coordinate our limited resources, and somehow find a way to protect against something that wanted to unmake existence itself.

*No pressure,* I thought with dark humor that was becoming my default coping mechanism.

"Then we don't wait," I decided, the plan crystallizing in my mind even as I spoke. Sometimes the best strategy was the simplest one—not cleverness, not misdirection, but straightforward action before your opponent could complete their preparation. "We evacuate the Spire's repository. Move Marcus's legacy to a secure location the Devourer can't predict. If it attacks the Spire expecting to find the artifacts there and finds nothing—"

"It will adapt," Zephyra interrupted, and the certainty in her voice came from hard-won experience. "Hunt for the new location. We'd buy time, yes, but not much. And moving artifacts of that power level... every supernatural faction will sense it. You'd be advertising that you have something valuable enough to relocate, making yourself a target not just for the Devourer but for anyone who wants Prime Archon power for themselves."

She wasn't wrong. The supernatural world operated on awareness—powerful magic left signatures, significant workings created ripples that anyone paying attention would notice. Moving Marcus's preserved blood and artifacts would be like lighting a beacon that screamed "valuable things here." Every ambitious Archon, every power-hungry vampire, every faction that saw opportunity in chaos would take notice.

*And in three days, we don't have the resources to fend off treasure hunters while also fighting the Devourer,* I realized.

But I was tired of reacting, tired of dancing to the Devourer's rhythm. Every crisis so far had been on its terms—reality tears manifesting where it chose, when it chose, forcing us to scramble and respond with whatever resources we could muster in the moment.

I was done being reactive.

"Then we use that," I said firmly, feeling the weight of command settling onto my shoulders as the strategy took shape. "Make the relocation obvious. Draw attention. Because while everyone is watching the transport, we set a trap at the Spire. When the Devourer attacks expecting to find the repository, it finds us instead—ready, prepared, and dug in for a fight."

"A final battle," Lady Seraphina murmured, and for the first time since I'd met her, there was something like approval in her voice. "On our terms rather than waiting for it to choose the time and place."

"Exactly. We've been playing defense. It's time to go on the offense."

The shift in strategy was subtle but crucial. Not waiting for the Devourer to attack when we were exhausted, scattered, unprepared. Instead, choosing the ground, preparing the battlefield, being ready with all our resources in place when it came. Turning its predictability—its singular focus on consuming Marcus's legacy—into a weapon against it.

Viktor grinned, all teeth and battle-hungry anticipation. The expression was unsettling on his massive werewolf face, but I understood it. After days of defensive fighting, after watching his pack bleed while we scrambled to react, the chance to take the initiative called to something primal in his nature. "Now *that* sounds like a plan. When do we start?"

"Now," I said, looking around at each person present. Morgana, exhausted but determined. Zephyra, ancient and carrying the weight of her own world's fall. Lady Seraphina, calculating but committed. Corvinus, wise and pragmatic. Viktor, loyal and fierce. And Raechelle, my anchor and strength.

*This is my war council,* I thought. *These are the people I'm trusting with reality itself.*

"Because in three days, we end this. One way or another."

The words hung in the air, heavy with promise and threat. One way or another implied both victory and defeat, survival and oblivion. But at least we'd face it on our terms, prepared and united rather than scattered and reactive.

*Win or die trying. No other options left.*

The next seventy-two hours were a controlled chaos of preparation.

I'd been in combat situations before. Had organized defenses, coordinated strikes, managed resources under pressure. But this was different. This wasn't a tactical engagement or a political maneuvering. This was preparing for the end of the world, trying to account for every variable while knowing that the enemy could adapt faster than we could predict.

*Chess against an opponent who can see the future and change the rules,* I thought during one particularly frustrating planning session. *How do you win that game?*

The answer, I was learning, was that you didn't try to win on cleverness. You won through preparation, redundancy, and having enough backup plans that when everything inevitably went wrong, you could still salvage victory from the chaos.

Viktor's packs established fortified positions around the Archon Spire, creating defensive layers that would force the Devourer to fight through multiple barriers to reach the central chamber. I watched them work, impressed by their military efficiency. Trenches were dug in concentric circles, each one designed to funnel attackers into kill zones. Reinforced positions at key points gave defenders cover while maintaining clear lines of sight. Supply caches were hidden throughout, ensuring that no one would run out of weapons or medical supplies no matter how long the battle lasted.

The werewolves approached defense with the pragmatism of people who understood that war was about attrition as much as heroism. Every position had a fallback point. Every defender knew exactly where to retreat when their section became untenable. And every layer was designed to buy time—minutes, sometimes just seconds—for the next layer to prepare.

"It's not about holding forever," Viktor explained during one inspection. "It's about making them pay for every inch. By the time they reach the Spire proper, they should be exhausted, diminished, vulnerable."

Morgana and her witches crafted ritual circles designed specifically to channel anti-reality energy—weapons that could actually harm something that existed partially outside normal existence. This was experimental magic, the kind of working that could backfire spectacularly if not handled perfectly. I watched her direct her coven with precise intensity, each witch positioned to contribute their specialty to the overall structure.

The circles themselves were works of art and mathematics. Complex geometric patterns that seemed to shift and flow even when static, incorporating principles I barely understood. Morgana explained some of it—how certain patterns resonated with reality's fundamental structure, how others created dissonance that could disrupt void-energy, how the entire construction was designed to turn the Devourer's own nature against it.

"It's like creating an immune response," she said during one explanation. "Reality recognizing a foreign object and mobilizing to reject it. We're just... helping that process along."

The work was exhausting even to watch. Each circle required hours of careful construction, with Morgana double and triple-checking every symbol, every line, every power nexus. One mistake could render the entire structure useless or, worse, turn it into a weapon against us. But she persisted, driven by the knowledge that these workings might be the difference between victory and extinction.

Corvinus organized evacuation protocols for civilian populations within a hundred miles of the Spire. This was the unglamorous but essential work—ensuring that when the battle came, innocent bystanders wouldn't be caught in the crossfire. I watched him coordinate with local authorities, supernatural and mundane alike, creating evacuation routes and shelter protocols that could move hundreds of thousands of people in hours if necessary.

"Most won't believe the danger is real," he explained during one coordination meeting. "They'll resist leaving their homes, their lives. But we prepare anyway. Because when reality tears open and void-tendrils start consuming everything, they'll need those evacuation routes to still be viable."

The pragmatism was grim but necessary. We couldn't save everyone—that was a truth I'd accepted weeks ago. But we could save as many as possible by planning for the worst and hoping we were over-prepared rather than under-prepared.

Lady Seraphina, to her credit, used her political influence to secure cooperation from factions that had been on the fence about supporting our efforts. I listened to her make calls, hearing her leverage old favors, make new promises, and occasionally resort to barely-veiled threats to bring reluctant allies into the fold.

"Pride is a luxury we can't afford," she said after one particularly contentious negotiation. "Some of these factions would rather die than admit they need your protection, Riven. So I'm helping them see that cooperation isn't weakness—it's survival."

The fact that she was doing this—expending her considerable political capital to support my defensive efforts—spoke volumes about how seriously she took the threat. Seraphina wasn't altruistic. She was calculating. And her calculations had clearly concluded that supporting me was more likely to lead to survival than any alternative strategy.

*The enemy of my enemy is my ally,* I thought. *At least until the immediate crisis passes. After that, we'll see.*

And Zephyra trained me relentlessly.

The training was brutal in ways that physical combat never could be. It wasn't about muscles or reflexes—it was about pushing my magical capabilities beyond their current limits, stretching my capacity to channel power until the structures that should have shattered under the strain were forced to adapt and strengthen.

"Again," she commanded as I collapsed from the latest exercise, sweat pouring down my face and muscles screaming in protest. We were in a secure training ground Viktor had designated, far enough from civilian populations that if I lost control the damage would be contained. "You need to be able to maintain five-affinity manifestation for at least thirty minutes if you want to survive the fight. Right now you're barely hitting ten."

"Because it feels like trying to juggle chainsaws while running a marathon," I gasped, but forced myself back to my feet. Pride wouldn't let me stay down, not when she was standing there looking barely winded after three thousand years of being able to do this effortlessly. "The energy drain alone—"

"Will kill you if you don't learn to manage it," Zephyra finished bluntly, no sympathy in her voice because sympathy wouldn't help me survive what was coming. "Prime Archon power isn't just about having five affinities. It's about sustaining them simultaneously without burning yourself out. Marcus could fight for hours at full power. You need to at least approach that level."

She was right, of course. But that didn't make the training any less brutal. Channeling five affinities simultaneously was like trying to think in five different languages while solving complex mathematics in each one. My brain wasn't designed for that kind of multitasking. Neither was my body, which kept trying to shut down under the strain of processing energies that normal physiology couldn't handle.

But I pushed through. Because the alternative was facing the Devourer with inadequate preparation and watching everyone die because I wasn't strong enough.

Raechelle watched from the sidelines, ready to intervene if I pushed too far, her concern a constant presence through our bond. I felt her anxiety every time I stumbled, her pride when I managed to maintain the five-affinity state for a few seconds longer than before. She understood what I was doing and why, but that didn't make it easier to watch.

*I'm sorry,* I wanted to tell her. *Sorry that you have to watch me hurt myself in preparation for potentially dying in a few days.*

But I didn't say it. Because we both knew the necessity, and verbalizing it would just make the waiting harder.

Elena had wanted to participate in the training, but I'd firmly (and after much argument) convinced her that her role would be in the support network—channeling power to the primary fighters rather than engaging directly. She'd argued, of course. Insisted she could help, that she'd proven herself capable at the northern breach. And she was right. But I couldn't—wouldn't—put my fifteen-year-old daughter on the front lines of what might be the apocalypse if there was any alternative.

"You're sidelining me because I'm your daughter," she'd accused during one particularly heated argument.

"I'm positioning you strategically because you're a capable channeler with potential you haven't fully realized yet," I'd countered. "The support network is crucial, Elena. Without people channeling power to the primary defenders, we all die. It's not a lesser role—it's different but equally vital."

She'd accepted that, though I could tell she wasn't entirely satisfied. But sometimes parental authority still counted for something, even in the supernatural world where power often trumped traditional hierarchies.

On the second day, as Viktor's wolves dug in defensive positions and Morgana's witches established their ritual circles, reality tears started appearing with increasing frequency. Small ones, probes testing our defenses. We sealed each one efficiently—not with the massive coordinated effort of the northern breach, but with quick response teams that had gotten disturbingly good at handling these incursions.

Each seal taught us something new. How the void-energy reacted to different types of magic. Where the weak points in reality's fabric lay. What tactics worked best for disrupting the Devourer's manifestations. We were learning, adapting, becoming more efficient.

But the pattern was clear—the Devourer was scouting, learning our capabilities, assessing our readiness. Each probe gathered intelligence, analyzed our responses, identified potential weaknesses. It knew we were preparing. And it was preparing too.

On the third day, something changed.

The probes stopped. The reality tears ceased manifesting. An eerie calm settled over our territories, the kind of stillness that comes before a storm.

*It's coming,* I thought, feeling the weight of certainty settle into my chest like lead.

"It's coming," Zephyra said quietly as we stood atop the Archon Spire, looking out over the assembled defenders. "Tonight, or early tomorrow. I can feel it gathering strength, marshaling everything it has."

The Spire rose three hundred feet above the surrounding territory, a monument to Blood Archon power built three millennia ago and still standing despite everything history had thrown at it. From this vantage point, I could see the full scope of our preparations. Viktor's werewolves in their defensive positions, looking like an army ready for war. Morgana's ritual circles glowing softly with contained power, waiting to be triggered. Corvinus's vampires positioned at key ley line intersections, ready to redirect magical energy. Lady Seraphina's elite guard stationed at critical choke points.

And everywhere, the supernatural defenders who'd answered the call. Hundreds of magic users, warriors, and specialists from a dozen different factions, united by the shared understanding that this fight was about survival itself.

*We've built something impossible here,* I realized. *Not an army—a coalition. People who normally wouldn't work together, who have conflicting interests and old grudges, all setting that aside because the alternative is oblivion.*

"Are we ready?" I asked, knowing the question was almost meaningless. Were we ever ready for something like this? Could you prepare adequately for the end of the world?

"Ready as we'll ever be," Zephyra replied. Then, surprisingly, she placed a hand on my shoulder—the first time she'd offered anything resembling comfort since we'd met. The gesture was tentative, as if she wasn't quite sure how to express what she was feeling. "Marcus would be proud of you, you know. The way you've brought people together, coordinated this defense. He could wield incredible power, but he struggled with leadership. You have both."

The compliment hit harder than I expected. Coming from someone who'd actually known Marcus, who'd fought beside him and watched him fall, it meant something. Validation from someone who understood what being a Prime Archon truly meant.

"I'm not sure it will be enough."

The admission came out quieter than intended, carrying all the doubt and fear I'd been suppressing for three days. Because that was the truth, wasn't it? Despite all our preparation, all our coordination, all our desperate efforts to turn the tide—I still wasn't sure we could win.

"It will have to be," she said simply, her voice carrying three thousand years of hard-won wisdom. "Because there's no alternative. We fight, we win, or we cease to exist. Those are the only options."

As if summoned by her words, the horizon flickered. Once, twice, then continuously—reality itself beginning to tear along every confluence point simultaneously.

The Devourer was here.

And it was bringing everything.
