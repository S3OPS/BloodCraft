# Chapter 39: Echoes of the Past

**Word Count**: ~6,200 words  
**POV**: Riven Sixxx  
**Timeline**: Five years after Book Three conclusion

---

The alarm on my phone buzzed at precisely 6:00 AM, as it had every morning for the past five years. I silenced it before the second chime, my hand moving with the practiced ease of routine. Beside me, Raechelle stirred but didn't wake—centuries of light sleeping habits meant she'd already been aware of the alarm before it sounded, but she'd learned to let me handle the morning rituals.

I slipped out of bed, careful not to disturb her, and padded barefoot to the window. Our bedroom overlooked the eastern gardens of the estate, where the first hints of dawn were just beginning to paint the sky in shades of amber and rose. Five years of peace. Five years of building something lasting. Five years of watching Elena grow into the remarkable young woman she was becoming.

It felt almost too good to last.

I pushed that thought away—a remnant of the old paranoia that had defined my early years as a Blood Archon. Terravos was dead. The Council was stable. The supernatural world had entered an era of unprecedented cooperation. I had earned this peace, earned the right to believe it might continue.

The soft sound of footsteps in the hallway told me Elena was already awake, probably heading to the training room for her pre-dawn practice. At fifteen, she had more discipline than I'd possessed at twenty-three. More control too, though that was partly my doing—I'd made sure she learned to master her power rather than fear it.

"You're brooding," Raechelle's voice came from behind me, sleep-rough and amused. "I can feel it through the bond."

I turned to find her sitting up in bed, dark hair tousled, eyes gleaming with the faint crimson that always appeared in low light. Even after all these years, the sight of her made my breath catch.

"Not brooding," I said. "Contemplating."

"Mmm. Your contemplation feels suspiciously like brooding." She stretched, all feline grace, then rose to join me at the window. "What's bothering you?"

"Nothing specific. Just..." I gestured vaguely at the peaceful morning. "It's been quiet. Too quiet, maybe."

"Five years of quiet, and you're complaining?" She leaned against me, fitting perfectly into my side as she always did. "Most people would call that a blessing."

"Most people aren't responsible for maintaining the Balance."

She was silent for a moment, and I felt her concern ripple through our bond. "You've been having the dreams again."

It wasn't a question. Through our familiar bond, she knew. She always knew.

"Not the same dreams," I admitted. "But... something's coming. I can feel it. Like a storm building on the horizon."

"Your instincts are usually right." She turned to face me fully, her expression serious now. "Have you consulted the Council?"

"Not yet. I have nothing concrete to report. Just a feeling." I ran a hand through my hair, frustrated. "But it's getting stronger. Whatever it is, it's not going to stay distant much longer."

Before Raechelle could respond, a sharp knock on our door interrupted us.

"Dad?" Elena's voice carried a note of urgency that immediately set my nerves on edge. "Sorry to interrupt, but you need to see this."

I threw on a robe and opened the door. Elena stood there in her training clothes, her face pale and her eyes—my eyes, inherited from our bloodline—wide with concern. In her hand, she held a crystal orb that pulsed with an irregular crimson light.

"One of the sentinel wards just activated," she said. "The eastern perimeter. Something tried to breach our defenses."

My blood magic flared instinctively, crimson energy crackling around my fingertips as old combat reflexes kicked in. Raechelle was already moving, her vampire speed carrying her to the closet where we kept our weapons and gear.

"Show me," I said to Elena, already heading for the hallway.

---

The estate's security room was one of my additions after Book Three—a concession to Raechelle's insistence that "hoping for peace" and "preparing for threats" weren't mutually exclusive. The room was filled with magical monitoring equipment, combining traditional ward-crafting with modern technology in ways that would have baffled supernatural beings from even a century ago.

Viktor's work, mostly. The werewolf alpha had a knack for blending old magic with new innovation.

Elena set the crystal orb into its mounting bracket, and immediately a three-dimensional map of the estate materialized in the air above the central console. The eastern perimeter glowed an angry red where something had triggered the sentinel ward.

"When did it activate?" I asked, studying the display.

"About ten minutes ago," Elena said. "I was in the training room and felt it through the blood ward network. By the time I got here, whatever it was had already retreated."

"Retreated or been repelled?" Raechelle asked, joining us. She was dressed for combat now, twin daggers strapped to her thighs, her hair pulled back in a severe braid.

"I'm not sure," Elena admitted. "The ward recorded some data before it reset. I haven't analyzed it yet."

I reached out with my blood magic, interfacing with the ward network directly. The wards recognized me instantly—they were crafted from my own power, after all—and flooded my consciousness with information.

What I found made my blood run cold.

"This wasn't a random probe," I said slowly. "This was deliberate. Professional. Someone was testing our defenses."

"Who?" Elena asked. "I thought all the major threats were neutralized after..." She hesitated, not wanting to mention Terravos. Even five years later, the memory of that final battle carried weight.

"They were," Raechelle said, but her tone suggested she was reassessing that assumption. "At least, all the known threats."

I pulled up the ward's recording, and we watched as a shadow—that was the only way to describe it, a shape of pure darkness—approached the perimeter. The moment it touched the ward, crimson energy flared, and the shadow recoiled. But not before leaving something behind.

"There," I said, pausing the recording. "Did you see that?"

Elena leaned closer. "It looks like... a mark?"

I enhanced the image, and my suspicions crystallized into certainty. Carved into the magical barrier before it healed was a symbol: a circle with five points radiating outward, each point representing one of the magical disciplines. Blood. Fire. Water. Earth. Air.

The symbol of a Prime Archon.

"Impossible," Raechelle breathed. "No one knows about—"

"Someone knows," I cut her off, my mind racing. "Or at least, someone suspects."

Marcus's ring felt heavy on my finger, the artifact that had hidden my true nature for so long. For fifteen years, it had protected me, made me appear as merely a powerful Blood Archon rather than what I truly was. But if someone had discovered the truth...

"Dad?" Elena's voice pulled me back to the present. "What does that symbol mean? I've never seen it before."

I exchanged a glance with Raechelle. We'd kept the secret even from Elena, not out of lack of trust but out of a desire to protect her from the burden of that knowledge. But if someone was actively hunting for a Prime Archon, if they'd already found our home...

"It's time," Raechelle said quietly, reading my thoughts through our bond. "She needs to know."

I nodded slowly. "Elena, sit down. There's something I need to tell you about our family's heritage. About what I really am."

---

Telling Elena the truth took an hour. I explained about the Prime Archon legend, about how rare and powerful such beings were, about why Marcus and Elara had hidden my nature from the world. I showed her how the ring worked, how it suppressed my true power signature. I demonstrated, briefly and carefully, my ability to wield all five disciplines at once—something that should have been impossible.

To her credit, Elena took it all remarkably well. At fifteen, she'd already seen enough of the supernatural world to understand that secrets were sometimes necessary for survival.

"So you're not just a Blood Archon," she said finally. "You're... what, a myth made real?"

"Something like that," I admitted. "Though I try not to think of it in those terms. It makes things complicated."

"And someone just told the entire supernatural community about this?" Her eyes narrowed. "That's what the symbol means, right? Someone's announcing that they know what you are?"

"Not quite," Raechelle said. "If they wanted to announce it, they would have. This is something else. This is..." She frowned, thinking. "This is a calling card. A challenge."

"Or a warning," I added. "Someone wants me to know they've discovered the secret. The question is what they plan to do with that information."

Elena stood abruptly. "We need to tell the Council. Warn them. If there's someone out there powerful enough to breach our wards and knowledgeable enough to recognize Prime Archon symbols—"

"We can't tell the Council," I said firmly. "Not yet. Not until we know who we're dealing with and what they want."

"But—"

"Elena." I softened my tone. "If the Council learns I'm a Prime Archon, even with the best intentions, word will spread. And once word spreads, every faction will have to decide what to do about it. Some will want to ally with me. Others will see me as a threat. And a few..." I hesitated. "A few will want to eliminate me before I can become too powerful."

"That's insane," Elena protested. "You've been protecting the supernatural world for fifteen years. You're the Balance. Everyone knows you're not a threat."

"Everyone knows Riven Sixxx, the Blood Archon who defeated Terravos," Raechelle corrected gently. "They don't know Riven Sixxx, the Prime Archon whose power could theoretically overthrow entire supernatural governments. That's a very different threat profile."

Elena's jaw clenched—a gesture she'd inherited from me—but she nodded reluctantly. "So what do we do?"

"We investigate," I said. "Quietly. We find out who left that symbol and what they want. And we do it without alerting anyone else to the situation."

"Should we call Viktor? Morgana?" Raechelle suggested. "They know the truth. They could help."

I considered it. Viktor and Morgana were among the very few who knew my secret, trusted allies who'd stood by me even after learning what I was. But bringing them in meant expanding the circle of knowledge, increasing the risk of exposure.

"Not yet," I decided. "For now, it's just us. If we need reinforcements, we'll call them. But first, I want to do some reconnaissance of my own."

"You're going to the breach point," Elena said. It wasn't a question.

"Tonight, after dark. I want to examine the area myself, see if our mystery visitor left any other clues."

"I'm coming with you," Elena said immediately.

"No—"

"Yes," she insisted. "Dad, I'm not a child anymore. I'm a Blood Archon in my own right. I've trained for years for situations exactly like this. And more importantly, I have a right to know what threats are facing our family."

I wanted to argue, wanted to lock her away somewhere safe where the dangers of my life couldn't touch her. But she was right—she wasn't a child anymore. And protecting her by keeping her ignorant would only leave her vulnerable if something happened to Raechelle and me.

"Fine," I said finally. "But you follow my lead. If I tell you to run, you run. No arguments, no heroics. Understood?"

"Understood," she agreed, though the glint in her eyes suggested she'd reserve the right to ignore those orders if the situation called for it.

She definitely inherited my stubbornness along with my eyes.

I spent the rest of the morning attending to my normal responsibilities—Council meeting via magical communication, training session with two young Blood Archons who'd come to study under me, lunch with Viktor to discuss trade agreements between the werewolf territories and the vampire clans. All routine, all important, all part of maintaining the peace I'd worked so hard to establish.

But beneath it all, my mind churned with questions. Who had found us? How had they discovered the secret? And most importantly—what did they want?

The symbol haunted me. A Prime Archon mark, placed deliberately where I'd find it. Not a threat, exactly. More like a signature. Someone announcing their knowledge, their capability, their... what? Interest? Challenge?

"You're distracted," Viktor observed during our lunch meeting. The werewolf alpha looked older than when we'd first met, grey streaking his dark hair, but his eyes were still sharp. "Something bothering you?"

"Just some minor estate security issues," I deflected. "Nothing to worry about."

Viktor studied me for a long moment, then shrugged. "If you need help, you know where to find me. The pack is always ready."

"I know," I said, meaning it. "And I appreciate it."

After Viktor left, I retreated to my study to do some research. If someone knew about Prime Archons, they had to have gotten that knowledge somewhere. The legend was old, buried in ancient texts that most supernatural beings considered myth rather than history.

I pulled out the oldest books in my collection—volumes I'd inherited from my mother's library, texts that predated modern supernatural civilization by millennia. Most were written in languages that required magical translation to read, their pages preserved by spells that prevented decay.

Three hours of searching finally yielded something useful.

"*The Prime Archon walks between all worlds, master of every discipline, bound by none. They appear in ages of great change, harbingers of transformation that can save civilizations... or destroy them. They are both hope and terror, both savior and threat. When a Prime Archon rises, the supernatural world must choose: embrace the change they bring, or eliminate them before that change can occur.*"

The text was from something called the *Codex Primordium*, supposedly written by the very first Archons who'd discovered the five disciplines. I'd read it before, but always dismissed it as poetic mythologizing.

Now I wondered if the ancient authors had been more literal than I'd realized.

"*To identify a Prime Archon, look for these signs: mastery of multiple disciplines at a young age, bonds that resonate with unusual intensity, power that feels 'wrong' to those who encounter it. But beware—Prime Archons are often hidden, their true nature suppressed by artifacts or spells, for the world's reaction to their existence is rarely kind.*"

I closed the book slowly, my hands trembling slightly. Someone had read this text. Someone had put the pieces together. Someone knew.

But who?

---

As night fell, I prepared for the reconnaissance mission. Raechelle insisted on coming, and I knew better than to argue—where I went, she went. That was the nature of our bond, our partnership. Elena would join us at the breach point, approaching from a different angle to ensure we weren't walking into an ambush.

I dressed for combat but not for show—dark clothing that would blend into shadows, Marcus's ring firmly on my finger, my blood magic coiled and ready. The twin daggers Raechelle had given me for our tenth anniversary hung at my waist, their blades etched with runes that enhanced blood magic.

"Ready?" Raechelle asked, appearing beside me in the hallway. She'd dressed similarly, her usual elegance replaced by lethal practicality.

"As I'll ever be," I said.

We made our way to the eastern perimeter on foot, moving through the estate's grounds with the ease of long familiarity. The gardens were quiet this time of night, the magical wards humming softly as we passed. Everything seemed normal, peaceful.

But I couldn't shake the feeling that we were being watched.

Elena met us at the breach point, emerging from the shadows so silently I nearly struck first and asked questions later. "Nothing," she reported. "I've circled the area twice. If anyone's here, they're very good at hiding."

"Or they're long gone," Raechelle said, though her tone suggested she didn't believe that.

I knelt at the spot where the shadow had touched the ward, examining it with both physical sight and magical senses. The Prime Archon symbol was still there, faint but visible, etched into the magical fabric of the ward itself.

"How is this even possible?" Elena asked, studying the symbol with fascination and concern. "To leave a permanent mark on a blood ward, you'd need to be... what, an Archon yourself?"

"At minimum," I agreed. "Probably more. This level of precision, the ability to breach the ward without triggering a full alarm... whoever did this is extremely skilled."

I reached out with my blood magic, trying to analyze the residue left behind. The shadow had left traces, faint impressions of power that made my instincts scream warnings I couldn't quite articulate.

And then I felt it. A presence. Not physical but magical, a consciousness brushing against my own with shocking intimacy.

"*Hello, Riven Sixxx,*" a voice whispered directly into my mind. "*Or should I say... Prime Archon?*"

I spun, crimson energy exploding around me in defensive response. Beside me, Raechelle shifted into combat stance, her vampire nature rising to the surface. Elena's own blood magic flared, power crackling around her hands.

But there was no one there. Just the three of us, standing in an empty garden, surrounded by wards that should have alerted us to any intrusion.

"*Don't bother looking,*" the voice continued, amused. "*I'm not there. This is merely a... recorded message, shall we say? Triggered when you examined my calling card.*"

"Who are you?" I demanded, sending my consciousness along the magical connection, trying to trace it back to its source.

"*Someone who knows what you are. Someone who understands the burden you carry, the secret you've kept for fifteen years.*" A pause. "*Someone who can help you... if you're willing to listen.*"

"Help?" I said skeptically. "By breaching my wards and threatening my family?"

"*I haven't threatened anyone. I've merely... announced my presence. Demonstrated my capabilities.*" Another pause. "*You've spent fifteen years hiding, Riven. Pretending to be something less than you are. Playing at being the Balance while suppressing your true potential. Don't you ever wonder what you could accomplish if you stopped hiding?*"

"I'm not hiding," I shot back. "I'm surviving. There's a difference."

"*Is there? Or have you simply convinced yourself of that?*" The voice carried a hint of challenge now. "*The supernatural world is changing, Prime Archon. Old powers are waking. Ancient conflicts are resurfacing. And whether you like it or not, you're going to be forced to choose a side.*"

"I don't take sides," I said firmly. "I maintain the Balance."

"*Noble. Naive. And ultimately futile.*" The presence began to withdraw, the connection fading. "*But I didn't come here to argue with you. I came to deliver a warning and an invitation.*"

"Warning?" Raechelle interjected. "About what?"

"*About what's coming. About the storm that's been building for years, waiting for the right moment to break.*" The voice was barely a whisper now. "*Three days from now, go to the old Sanctum in the northern territories. Alone. I'll be waiting to explain everything.*"

"Why should I trust you?" I demanded.

"*You shouldn't,*" the voice admitted. "*But you will, because your curiosity won't let you ignore this. Because deep down, you know something's wrong. You've felt it for months, haven't you? The sense that the peace you've built is just a calm before a greater storm.*"

The connection severed completely, leaving only silence and the gentle rustle of leaves in the night breeze.

For a long moment, none of us spoke. Then Elena broke the silence.

"Please tell me you're not actually considering going to this meeting," she said. "Because that has 'trap' written all over it."

"It does," I agreed. "But they're right about one thing—I have been feeling that something's wrong. And if there really is a threat coming, I need to know what it is."

"Then we all go," Raechelle said firmly. "No arguments."

"The message said alone."

"And we're going to ignore that part," she countered. "Riven, whoever this is, they know your biggest secret. They demonstrated they can breach our defenses. And they're trying to lure you to a remote location. There's no universe in which I let you walk into that alone."

I looked at Elena, who nodded in agreement. "Mom's right. Lone hero missions are how people get killed in horror movies."

Despite the tension, I couldn't help but smile. "You two gang up on me."

"Always," they said in unison.

"Fine," I conceded. "We all go. But carefully. And if it looks even slightly like a trap, we retreat immediately."

"Agreed," Raechelle said.

We made our way back to the house, all of us on high alert, but the rest of the night passed without incident. Whoever our mysterious visitor was, they'd said their piece and departed.

But as I lay in bed that night, unable to sleep despite my exhaustion, I couldn't stop thinking about their words. *Old powers waking. Ancient conflicts resurfacing.*

Five years of peace. Five years of believing the worst was behind us.

I had a sinking feeling those five years were about to come to an end.
