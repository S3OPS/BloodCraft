# **Chapter 23.5**

## The Price of Leadership

The healing ward smelled of herbs, copper, and the peculiar tang of supernatural blood—distinct from human blood in ways I'd never noticed before my awakening. Each species had its own scent signature: vampires carried an undertone of preserved roses, werewolves smelled of earth and wild things, witches bore traces of whatever magic they practiced most. Now, walking through the long hall of recovering warriors, I could identify each without looking.

Thirteen beds stood empty. Permanently empty.

I'd ordered them left that way, a visual reminder of what we'd lost. The Council had questioned the decision—said it was morbid, that it hurt morale. But I needed everyone who came to this ward to see those empty spaces. To remember that war had a cost beyond strategic victories and territorial gains.

"Lord Sixxx," a vampire healer named Casimir acknowledged as I entered. He was ancient, one of the few old enough to have known my grandparents. His silver hair was pulled back in a neat braid, and his hands moved with practiced efficiency as he checked a werewolf's bandaged shoulder. "She's in the back, resting comfortably. The internal damage is healing well."

"Thank you." I moved past him, past row after row of injured defenders. A young witch with burns across half her face. An elemental whose left arm terminated in a hastily cauterized stump—the limb too damaged by Titan magic to regenerate. A vampire whose chest had been caved in by falling rubble, now held together by a combination of healing magic and sheer supernatural resilience.

Each one had fought for Nocturne. For me. Because I'd asked them to stand against something that had nearly destroyed us all.

Raechelle occupied a private alcove at the ward's far end, propped against pillows with her panther form draped across her lap like a living shadow. The smaller form allowed her to project her consciousness more easily while her primary body healed. Her eyes—violet in both forms—tracked me as I approached.

"You're hovering again," she said, her mental voice carrying amusement despite the exhaustion I felt through our bond. "I can feel your guilt from here. Stop it."

"Easy for you to say." I settled into the chair beside her bed, reaching out to run my fingers through her fur. The dual sensation was disorienting—feeling my touch both as the one giving it and the one receiving it through our connection. "You're the one who nearly died because I wasn't fast enough."

"I nearly died because a Titan is roughly the size of a mountain and considerably harder to kill," she corrected. "You saved me, Riven. Saved all of us. The fact that it wasn't a perfect rescue doesn't make it a failure."

I wanted to argue, but movement at the ward's entrance cut me short. A vampire I didn't recognize stood in the doorway, young by their standards—maybe a century old—with the kind of rigid posture that suggested military training. He held a sealed envelope bearing a wax seal I knew too well: the earth sigil of Terravos.

"Lord Sixxx," he said, approaching cautiously. "I apologize for the intrusion. Casimir said you were here." He held out the envelope. "This was delivered to the Council chambers an hour ago. They thought you should see it immediately."

My blood chilled. Terravos didn't send letters. He sent armies.

I took the envelope, noting the vampire's quick retreat. Smart man. I broke the seal and extracted a single sheet of heavy parchment. The handwriting was neat, almost elegant.

*Riven Sixxx,*

*Your display at the gates was impressive. Fourteen defenders dead, dozens more wounded, and yet you consider it a victory because the Titan failed to breach your walls. I commend your optimism.*

*Let me offer a counterpoint: I sacrificed one Titan—admittedly an expensive loss—to learn exactly how you fight, what powers you can bring to bear, and where your defenses are strongest. I now know that your shield requires conscious maintenance, that your warriors are brave but undisciplined, and that you rely heavily on a handful of powerful individuals rather than coordinated military force.*

*In chess, this is called a gambit. I've traded a minor piece for information that will ensure my victory.*

*Consider your memorial services. I'll be thinking of you.*

*-T*

"Riven?" Raechelle's voice cut through the rage building in my chest. "What is it?"

I handed her the letter, watching her expression darken as she read.

"Arrogant bastard," she hissed. "He's gloating about killing thirteen of our warriors."

"He's right though." The admission tasted like ash. "That attack was a test. He learned our capabilities, our response time, how we coordinate under pressure. And we learned... what? That Titans are hard to kill? We already knew that."

"You learned that you can kill one," Raechelle said firmly. "That matters more than you think. Every supernatural in Nocturne watched you face down a Titan and win. They saw you stand in front of that thing and refuse to break. That's not a small victory."

"Tell that to the families of the dead."

The words came out harsher than I intended. Raechelle's ears flattened in her panther form, but her eyes held sympathy rather than offense.

"You're going to do that now, aren't you?" she asked. "Visit the families."

"I have to."

"You don't have to do it today. You haven't slept in—"

"Thirty-six hours," I finished. "I know. But if I wait, if I put it off because I'm tired or because it's hard, then I'm just another leader who treats casualties as statistics. These people deserve better than that."

Raechelle sighed, a very human sound from her feline form. "Then I'm coming with you."

"You're injured."

"I'm healing. There's a difference." Her panther form melted away, replaced by her human body—still pale, still marked with fading bruises, but moving with the fluid grace that defined her. "Besides, you'll need the support. This kind of visit... it destroys people, Riven. Even Blood Archons."

She was right. I could feel the dread coiling in my stomach like a living thing. But she was also right that I needed to do this.

"All right," I said. "But we're keeping it short. You need rest."

"So do you."

"I'll rest when—"

"Don't you dare say when we win," Raechelle interrupted. "That's what got your mother killed. Pushing herself until there was nothing left to push. You're no good to anyone if you burn out before the real war begins."

The invocation of my mother stung, but it also worked. I nodded, accepting her point.

We left the healing ward together, stepping into Nocturne's eternal twilight. The city had taken on a muted quality since the attack, as though the sky itself was in mourning. Magic still flowed through the streets, but subdued, respectful. Even the ever-present music seemed softer.

Our first stop was the vampire district, to visit the family of Marcus Draven. He'd been young—only two centuries old—but fierce in his dedication to Nocturne's defense. The Titan's fist had caught him mid-leap, pulverizing him against the city wall before anyone could reach him.

His widow, Elena, greeted us at the door of their modest home. She was composed, her face a mask of aristocratic control, but I could see the devastation in her eyes.

"Lord Sixxx," she said, stepping back to let us enter. "And Lady Raechelle. Please, come in."

The house was filled with vampires—Marcus's family, friends, colleagues from the city guard. They all stood as I entered, acknowledging my presence with varying degrees of formality. Some looked at me with hope, others with poorly concealed resentment.

"I won't take much of your time," I said, addressing Elena directly. "I just wanted to tell you in person how sorry I am for your loss. Marcus was a brave warrior and a good man. He saved at least three others before—" My voice cracked. "Before the end. His sacrifice mattered."

Elena's mask cracked slightly. "Did it? Forgive me, Lord Sixxx, but he's still dead. We're still holding his memorial. And the Titan..." She gestured helplessly. "You killed it, yes. But was it worth thirteen lives? Could we have defended differently? Could—"

"Could I have saved him," I finished quietly. "That's what you want to ask. And the answer is: I don't know. Maybe if I'd been faster, if I'd positioned the defenders differently, if I'd anticipated Terravos's strategy better... maybe. But I didn't. I made the best decisions I could with the information I had, and those decisions cost your husband his life."

The room had gone silent. Every vampire was watching us now, waiting to see how this would play out.

"I can't undo what happened," I continued. "I can't bring Marcus back. What I can do is promise you that his death will not be meaningless. We will stop Terravos. We will protect Nocturne. And when we do, when history remembers this war, Marcus Draven's name will be among the heroes who made our victory possible."

Elena stared at me for a long moment. Then, slowly, she nodded. "He would have appreciated that. Marcus always said..." She swallowed hard. "He said you were different from other leaders. That you saw warriors as people, not resources. I hope that's true, Lord Sixxx. Because if we're going to keep dying for you, we need to know you actually care."

"I do," I said simply. "More than I can express."

She studied me, then extended her hand. I took it, feeling the cool grip of vampire skin against mine.

"Then we'll continue to fight," she said. "For Marcus. For Nocturne. And for whatever future we can build if we survive this."

---

The next three visits followed a similar pattern. Families in mourning, looking for answers I couldn't give. Some were understanding, others angry. One werewolf father physically threw me out of his house, screaming that I'd murdered his son with my arrogance. I let him rage, accepted his fury, because what else could I do? He was right. My decisions had consequences, and his son had paid the price.

By the time we reached the witch coven that had lost two members, I was emotionally raw. Raechelle's hand in mine was the only thing keeping me grounded.

Morgana Blackwood met us at the coven house door. Her weathered face showed sympathy as she took in our exhausted states.

"You didn't have to do this," she said quietly. "The families would have understood."

"No, I did have to do this," I replied. "These people deserved better than a formal letter of condolence."

"Come." She led us inside, where a makeshift memorial had been set up. Two witches—sisters, I learned—had died holding a section of the wall against the Titan's assault. Their names were Iris and Thalia Moonwhisper, and their family had gathered to celebrate their lives in the witch tradition: with fire, song, and shared memories.

The matriarch of the Moonwhisper family was ancient even by witch standards, her face so lined it looked like weathered leather. She approached me with slow, deliberate steps, leaning heavily on a gnarled staff.

"Blood Archon," she said, her voice surprisingly strong despite her apparent age. "You've come to apologize."

"I have."

"Don't." The word was sharp. "My granddaughters knew what they were doing. They chose to stand on that wall. They chose to hold the line even when the Titan focused its attention on them. And they died with power blazing from their hands and defiance in their hearts." She reached up and placed one weathered hand against my cheek. "That's not a death that needs apology. That's a death that deserves honor."

Tears stung my eyes. "They were so young."

"They were eighty-three and seventy-seven," the matriarch corrected. "Children by my standards, perhaps, but old enough to make their own choices. You didn't force them onto that wall, young Archon. They volunteered. They fought. And they died as witches should—protecting what matters." She smiled, and there was something fierce in the expression. "Don't you dare diminish that sacrifice with guilt. Honor it with victory."

Something inside me broke at those words. I'd been carrying the weight of thirteen deaths like they were all my personal failure, my shame to bear alone. But the matriarch was right. These warriors had made choices. They'd stood against impossible odds because they believed in something worth dying for.

That didn't make their deaths less tragic. But it did make them meaningful.

"Thank you," I whispered. "I'll honor them. I promise."

The matriarch nodded, satisfied. Then she turned to address the gathered family. "The Blood Archon has acknowledged our loss. Now, let us celebrate our daughters' lives in the proper way. With fire and joy and the certainty that they passed beyond the veil as heroes."

The ceremony that followed was beautiful in its intensity. Witches sang in languages I didn't recognize, their voices weaving harmonies that made the air itself shimmer. They told stories of Iris and Thalia's lives—not just their deaths, but their childhoods, their first spells, their triumphs and failures and the thousand small moments that made them who they were.

By the time we left the coven house hours later, I felt different. Still grief-stricken, still carrying the weight of command, but no longer crushed by it. These people had shown me that death in defense of something meaningful wasn't a failure of leadership—it was the price of standing against tyranny.

"You needed that," Raechelle said as we walked through the darkened streets. "Seeing how they remember their dead."

"I did," I agreed. "But it doesn't change the fundamental problem. Thirteen dead, Rae. Dozens wounded. And Terravos is just getting started."

"Then we need to be ready for what's coming."

---

The Council chambers were filled when we arrived for the emergency session. Every major faction was represented: vampires, werewolves, witches, elementals, and a dozen other supernatural species that called Nocturne home. The air crackled with tension and barely suppressed anger.

Lord Thornwick, an ancient vampire who'd served on the Council for centuries, stood to address me as I entered. "Lord Sixxx. We've reviewed the casualty reports from the Titan attack. Thirteen dead, forty-seven wounded severely enough to require extended healing. This is unacceptable."

"I agree," I said, refusing to rise to the bait. "Which is why we're here. To discuss how to prevent it from happening again."

"The simplest solution is surrender," Thornwick said bluntly. "Terravos has made his point. He can hurt us. He can kill our people. Perhaps it's time to negotiate terms—"

"No." Viktor's growl cut through the chamber like a blade. The werewolf alpha rose from his seat, his eyes flashing amber with barely controlled rage. "I've lost three pack members to this war already. Three warriors who stood with me for decades. I will not dishonor their sacrifice by bowing to the Earth Archon."

"You speak of honor," Thornwick countered. "I speak of survival. If we continue this fight, how many more will die? Fifty? A hundred? Everyone in this room?" He turned to address the full Council. "Terravos sent a Titan as a warning. What happens when he sends five? Ten? What happens when he deploys his full military force against our walls?"

"Then we meet him with our full force," I said quietly, and the room fell silent. "Lord Thornwick is right about one thing: Terravos was sending a message. But the message wasn't 'surrender or die.' It was 'I can hurt you.' And my message back is this: so can we."

I pulled out Terravos's letter and read it aloud, letting every word sink in. The Council chamber erupted in outrage—shouts of fury, calls for immediate retaliation, demands for blood.

I let them rage for a moment, then raised my hand. Silence fell reluctantly.

"Terravos thinks he's won because he learned our defensive capabilities," I said. "What he doesn't know is that defense was never my strategy. It was preparation. He wanted to see how we fight when cornered? Good. Now he'll learn how we fight when we choose the battlefield."

"You're suggesting offensive operations," Lady Seraphina said from her seat. The ancient vampire's expression was calculating. "Striking at his territory while he expects us to cower behind our walls."

"Not suggesting. Insisting." I moved to the center of the chamber, addressing them all. "Every moment we spend in reactive defense, Terravos grows stronger. He consolidates his power, gathers more allies, builds more weapons. The Titan attack wasn't his endgame—it was reconnaissance. He's planning something bigger, and if we wait for him to launch it, we'll be fighting on his terms."

"And if we strike first?" Morgana asked. "What then?"

"Then we hit his supply lines, his infrastructure, his ability to field an army. We make him fight on multiple fronts. We force him to defend instead of attack." I pulled out a map of the supernatural territories, spreading it on the Council table. "Terravos controls a vast domain, but it's stretched thin. He's made enemies. Suppressed rivals. Created resentments. We exploit those weaknesses."

Thornwick scoffed. "And how do you propose we do that? Waltz into Earth Archon territory and politely ask his enemies to betray him?"

"No," I said. "We do it with a strike team. Small, fast, surgical operations designed to gather intelligence and inflict maximum damage with minimum risk. We've already proven it can work."

That got their attention. Raechelle stepped forward, projecting images into the air above the table—scenes from our previous infiltration mission, intelligence we'd gathered, weaknesses we'd identified.

"Lord Sixxx is correct," she said. "Terravos's territory is vulnerable in ways he doesn't advertise. His lieutenants are ambitious and often in conflict with each other. His supply lines run through territories of lesser lords who resent his dominance. And his military forces are spread across a front that stretches hundreds of miles."

"You want to start a guerrilla war," Viktor said, and there was approval in his voice. "Hit and run. Make him bleed resources chasing shadows while we build our strength."

"Exactly," I confirmed. "But it requires the right warriors. People willing to operate behind enemy lines with minimal support. People who can improvise, adapt, and accept that some missions might not have extraction plans."

The Council chamber fell silent as the implications sank in.

"You're asking for volunteers to go on suicide missions," Thornwick said flatly.

"I'm asking for volunteers to go on high-risk missions that could change the course of this war," I corrected. "Yes, some might not come back. But the alternative is staying here, waiting for Terravos to send another Titan, and losing more people like Marcus Draven and Iris Moonwhisper to attacks we could have prevented."

"I'll volunteer," Viktor said immediately. "Along with my best warriors."

"As will I," Morgana added. "The Blackwood coven has witches who specialize in infiltration magic."

One by one, the Council members began pledging support. Not all of them—Thornwick and his faction remained opposed—but enough. Enough to build something that could hurt Terravos where he was weakest.

The session lasted five more hours. We hammered out logistics, debated tactics, argued about acceptable risk levels. By the end, we had the framework for a strike force that could operate independently of Nocturne's main defenses.

But as I left the Council chambers, exhaustion finally catching up with me, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was sending people to their deaths. Just in a different way than before.

---

I found Corvinus in the training grounds, working through sword forms in the pre-dawn darkness. The ancient vampire moved with a fluid grace that made combat look like dance, each strike precise and economical.

He finished his sequence before acknowledging me. "You should be sleeping."

"Can't," I admitted. "Every time I close my eyes, I see the empty beds in the healing ward."

Corvinus sheathed his blade and gestured for me to follow him. We walked to the edge of the training grounds, where a memorial stood—a simple stone marker engraved with hundreds of names.

"Every vampire whose name appears here died under my command," Corvinus said quietly. "Spanning eight centuries of wars, conflicts, and battles I thought were necessary. Some days, I can't remember half their faces. Other days, I remember all of them so clearly it feels like they died yesterday."

He turned to face me, his ancient eyes holding a sorrow that went beyond words. "This is the price of leadership, Riven. Not the tactical decisions or the political maneuvering. The price is carrying their names with you forever. Knowing that your choices put them in harm's way. Understanding that no matter how good your intentions, some of them will die."

"How do you bear it?" I asked.

"By making sure their deaths matter," he said simply. "By winning the wars they fought in. By building something worth the sacrifice they made. And by never, ever allowing myself to become numb to the cost."

He placed a hand on my shoulder, and the weight of his experience pressed down like a physical thing.

"You're doing it right," he continued. "Visiting the families, feeling the grief, questioning your decisions. That means you're still human, despite the heir power. The moment you stop feeling the weight of command is the moment you become a tyrant."

"What if I make the wrong call?" I asked. "What if I send people into situations I can't get them out of?"

"You will," Corvinus said bluntly. "It's inevitable. You'll make mistakes, and people will die because of them. The question isn't whether you'll fail—it's what you do after you fail. Do you learn from it? Adjust your tactics? Become better? Or do you make the same mistakes repeatedly because you're too proud to admit you were wrong?"

He drew his sword again, offering me the hilt. "Fight me. No blood magic, no Archon powers. Just blade work and physical skill."

I took the sword, confused. "Why?"

"Because sometimes the best way to clear your head is to focus on something simple. And because I need to see if you've been keeping up with your training."

We fought for an hour, our blades flashing in the dim light. Corvinus was better—centuries better—but I held my own. When we finally stopped, both breathing hard, I realized he was right. The simple physicality of the duel had cleared some of the fog from my mind.

"Better," Corvinus said approvingly. "You're learning to fight without relying solely on power. That's important."

"Why?"

"Because power can fail. Magic can be countered. But skill—true skill—is harder to negate." He retrieved a canteen of water and took a long drink before passing it to me. "When you face Terravos, you'll need more than Blood Archon abilities. You'll need to out-think him, out-maneuver him, find weaknesses he doesn't know he has. That requires a clear head and the ability to fight without supernatural advantages."

"You think I can beat him?"

Corvinus smiled, and it was the first time I'd seen genuine warmth in the expression. "I think you have a chance. Which is more than your mother had when she faced him. Learn from her mistakes, Riven. She tried to beat Terravos through direct confrontation, matching her power against his. Don't do that. Be smarter. Be more adaptable. And most importantly—" he tapped the memorial stone, "—remember what you're fighting for. Not glory, not revenge. For them. For the people who believe in you."

---

I returned home as true darkness began to give way to Nocturne's eternal twilight. Raechelle was waiting, already knowing through our bond that I needed her.

She'd prepared a bath—hot water infused with healing herbs, candles providing soft light. No words, just a gesture toward the bathroom and understanding in her eyes.

I sank into the water, letting the heat seep into my exhausted muscles. Raechelle joined me moments later, settling against my chest with a contented sigh.

"We're going to lose more people," I said quietly, voicing the fear that had been gnawing at me all night.

"We are," she agreed. "War demands sacrifice. You know that."

"Knowing it and accepting it are different things."

She shifted to look up at me, violet eyes searching my face. "You're afraid that one day you'll stop caring. That the deaths will become numbers instead of people."

"Yes."

"You won't," she said with absolute certainty. "I'm in your head, Riven. I feel what you feel. You care too much, if anything. Each death cuts you deeper than the last. That's not going to change."

"What if it has to?" I asked. "What if caring this much makes me weak? Makes me hesitate at crucial moments?"

"Then you'll hesitate," Raechelle said firmly. "And you'll live with the consequences. But you'll still be you—someone who sees warriors as people, not expendable resources. That's why Viktor follows you. Why Morgana trusts you. Why even the families of the dead still believe in you." She cupped my face in her hands. "Don't lose that. Even if it hurts. Especially if it hurts. Because the moment you stop feeling the cost is the moment you become like Terravos."

I pulled her close, drawing strength from her certainty. We stayed like that until the water grew cold, holding each other in the silence that comes when words are inadequate.

Later, in bed, with Raechelle curled against my side, I finally allowed myself to think about what came next. The strike team. The offensive operations. The escalation that would inevitably follow.

*Are you ready for this?* Raechelle asked through our bond.

*No,* I admitted. *But I'm doing it anyway.*

*That's what makes you a leader,* she replied. *Not being ready, but doing what needs to be done despite the fear.*

I thought about Marcus Draven, dying against the city wall. About Iris and Thalia Moonwhisper, holding the line with magic blazing from their hands. About the thirteen empty beds in the healing ward and the families who would never be whole again.

Terravos wanted to break us with fear. To make us believe that resistance was futile. But he'd made a critical miscalculation. Each person he killed, each family he shattered, didn't make Nocturne weaker. It made us more determined.

The price of leadership was bearing the weight of those deaths. But the reward—if we survived—would be a world where no one else had to pay that price.

I closed my eyes, finally allowing sleep to claim me. But before I drifted off, I made a silent promise to the thirteen who'd died defending Nocturne:

*Your deaths will matter. I'll make sure of it.*

---

Two days later, I stood in the training grounds watching volunteers assemble for the strike team evaluation. Over a hundred warriors had come forward—vampires, werewolves, witches, elementals, even a few species I couldn't immediately identify. All of them willing to risk everything for Nocturne's survival.

Viktor stood beside me, arms crossed, evaluating the candidates with his alpha's eye. "More than I expected."

"More than we can use," I replied. "We need twenty, maybe twenty-five at most. Any more and we lose the mobility advantage."

"Then we choose carefully." Viktor stepped forward, his voice carrying across the grounds. "Listen up! What we're building here isn't an army. It's a scalpel. Small, precise, surgical. That means we need warriors who can think independently, adapt to changing situations, and operate without backup. If you're used to fighting in formation with support, this isn't for you. If you need clear orders every step of the way, this isn't for you. We're looking for survivors—people who can infiltrate enemy territory, complete objectives, and get out alive."

He paused, letting that sink in. Several candidates shifted uncomfortably. A few actually turned and left. Good. Better to realize it now than in the field.

"We'll be conducting evaluations over the next three days," I added. "Combat trials, stealth challenges, problem-solving scenarios. But more than skills, we need to know we can trust you with our lives. Because on these missions, we're all we'll have. No reinforcements. No rescue parties. Just the team."

Raechelle materialized beside me in her panther form, her presence causing a ripple of awareness through the assembled warriors. "Those who make the cut will receive specialized training in infiltration, intelligence gathering, and asymmetric warfare. You'll learn to fight smart, not just hard. And you'll learn to operate as a unit despite coming from different supernatural species."

The evaluation process was brutal. We pushed candidates to their limits—physical endurance tests that left vampires gasping, magical challenges that drained witches dry, combat scenarios where the objective was survival rather than victory.

By the end of the first day, half the candidates had withdrawn. By the end of the second, we were down to forty. And by the end of the third day, we had our team: twenty-three warriors representing every major faction in Nocturne.

They stood before me in the training grounds, exhausted but determined. I recognized several faces from the Titan battle—survivors who'd seen the worst we faced and decided to fight anyway.

"You made it," I said simply. "Which means you're either incredibly skilled or incredibly stupid. Probably both." That earned a few tired laughs. "What we're about to do won't win the war. Not directly. But it will give us the intelligence and strategic advantages we need to fight on equal terms. Every mission you complete, every piece of information you gather, every supply line you disrupt—it all matters. It all adds up."

I looked at each of them in turn, committing their faces to memory. "Some of you might not come back. I won't lie about that. These missions are dangerous, and Terravos will hunt you relentlessly once he realizes what we're doing. But I promise you this: your sacrifices will not be wasted. Everything you do, I'll use to bring us one step closer to victory."

Viktor stepped forward. "Training begins tomorrow. We'll work you harder than you've ever been worked before. By the time we're done, you'll be able to infiltrate a fortress, steal its secrets, and vanish before anyone knows you were there."

Morgana joined us, her weathered face showing grim satisfaction. "And you'll learn to counter Terravos's magic. The Earth Archon relies on certain techniques, certain patterns. Once you understand them, you can exploit the weaknesses."

The team dispersed to rest, but three warriors remained: Kael, the young werewolf who'd fought beside me at the supply depot; Lysandra Blackwood, who'd apparently volunteered despite her aunt's protests; and a vampire named Sienna who I'd seen tear through training scenarios with ruthless efficiency.

"You three have questions," I observed.

"Just one," Sienna said. Her voice was soft, almost musical, which contrasted sharply with the deadly precision I'd seen her display. "When do we start the real operations? The training is useful, but we all know the best lessons come from actual combat."

"Soon," I promised. "We need to coordinate with our intelligence network, identify high-value targets, plan extraction routes. Give it two weeks."

"Two weeks," Kael repeated. "While Terravos plans his next attack."

"While Terravos thinks we're still recovering from the last one," I corrected. "Let him believe we're defensive. Let him think the Titan attack worked. And then, when he's comfortable, we hit him where he's weakest."

Lysandra studied me with calculating eyes. "You've changed since the memorial visits. More focused. Less guilt-ridden."

"Not less," I said quietly. "Just better at channeling it. The guilt doesn't go away. You just learn to carry it differently."

She nodded, apparently satisfied with that answer. The three of them left, leaving me alone in the training grounds as evening deepened into night.

Raechelle emerged from the shadows, resuming her human form. "You handled that well."

"Did I? Sometimes I feel like I'm making it up as I go along."

"You are," she said with a slight smile. "That's what leadership is—improvising with confidence while secretly terrified you're leading everyone to disaster."

"That's not reassuring."

"It's not meant to be. It's meant to be honest." She took my hand, lacing our fingers together. "Come on. You promised me you'd rest before the offensive begins. I'm holding you to that."

We walked back toward the Sixxx ancestral home, through streets that were slowly coming back to life. Nocturne was healing, adapting, preparing. The empty beds in the healing ward remained as reminders, but they were no longer symbols of defeat. They were motivation.

Thirteen had died. But thousands lived because of their sacrifice. And if I did my job right, their deaths would be the last unnecessary casualties Nocturne suffered.

That night, alone in the darkness of my room with Raechelle sleeping peacefully beside me, I allowed myself one moment of private grief. I thought about each of the fallen—their names, their faces, the stories their families had shared. I mourned them properly, without the weight of leadership forcing me to stay strong.

And then, when the grief had run its course, I channeled it into determination.

Terravos wanted a war? He'd get one. But not the war he expected.

We would strike from shadows. We would bleed his resources. We would make him fear what he couldn't see or predict.

And when he finally fell—and he would fall—it would be because thirteen warriors had held a wall against impossible odds, buying us the time we needed to become something more than a defensive city.

They would be remembered. Honored. Their sacrifice would echo through history as the turning point when Nocturne stopped merely surviving and started fighting to win.

That was the price of leadership. That was the burden I accepted.

And I would carry it until the war was won or I joined them in death.

No other option was acceptable.
