# **Chapter 0.5 - Raechelle's Perspective: Before the Binding**

*[Raechelle POV - Origin Story: 247 years before meeting Riven]*

---

They say memory fades with time, that the centuries blur together into an indistinct haze of faces and places that lose their sharp edges. They're wrong. Some memories don't fade. Some memories burn themselves into your soul so deeply that even two hundred years later, you can still smell the night-blooming jasmine in your mother's garden, can still hear your sisters' laughter echoing through stone halls, can still taste the copper-sweet tang of your first successful hunt.

I remember everything about the girl I was before I became what I am now.

Her name was Raechelle Darkpurr, youngest daughter of Lady Morrigan Darkpurr and Lord Silas Darkpurr, born into one of the oldest vampire-shifter clans in the Old World. She was wild and restless and completely uninterested in the political games that consumed her family. She wanted to hunt under the full moon, to feel the earth beneath her paws, to run so fast the world became nothing but wind and scent and the pure joy of *movement*.

She had no idea that before her twenty-fifth birthday, everything she knew would be stripped away, rebuilt, and bound to a destiny she'd never asked for.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. To understand what I became, you have to understand what I *was*.

---

The Darkpurr estate sprawled across three hundred acres of Romanian forest, all ancient stone and creeping ivy and secrets that whispered through the walls. It had been in our family for eight centuries, passed down through matriarchal lines from mother to daughter, protected by magic older than most modern countries.

We were rare, even among supernaturals. Most vampires couldn't shift—the magic didn't work that way, something about the undead nature conflicting with the life-force required for transformation. Most shifters couldn't tolerate the vampire transformation—their bodies rejected it, fought it, died screaming as incompatible magics tore them apart from the inside.

But the Darkpurr bloodline carried both gifts in perfect balance. We were born, not turned. We aged slowly, requiring blood for sustenance but walking freely in daylight. We could shift into great cats—panthers, mostly, though my eldest sister Morganna could take the form of a lioness when properly motivated. And we were bound to the ancient covenant that made us what we were: *familiars*.

Not servants. Never servants. We were *partners* to the Blood Archons, the magical elite who wielded blood magic like other people wielded swords. Our bloodline had been created for this purpose—bred, shaped, *crafted* over millennia to be the perfect complements to Archon power. Where they were raw strength, we were precision. Where they burned bright and fast, we endured. Where they ruled, we *protected*.

Every Darkpurr daughter knew from birth that eventually, she would be bound to an Archon. It was our purpose, our destiny, our *duty*. My three older sisters had already completed their bindings by the time I reached maturity. Morganna served the European Vampire Court. Seraphine had been sent to the Americas. Even Lyssa, barely thirty when she bonded, had found her match in the ancient Eastern dynasties.

I was the youngest. The wildest. The one my mother looked at with equal parts love and exasperation.

"You have your father's spirit," she told me once, as I came home covered in mud and deer blood, grinning like a fool after a particularly successful hunt. "All instinct and passion, no patience for the long game."

"Is that so terrible?" I'd asked, already knowing the answer.

"Not terrible, little shadow." She'd cupped my face in her hands, and I could see the sadness in her dark eyes. "Just... dangerous. The familiar bond requires control. Discipline. The ability to suppress your own needs for your Archon's sake." Her thumb had brushed my cheek. "I worry you'll lose yourself entirely when the time comes."

I'd laughed it off then. I was twenty-two, immortal, invincible in the way only the young can be. The bonding was still years away—I had time to become whoever I needed to be.

I was so beautifully, tragically naive.

---

My mother was the one who taught me everything that mattered.

Not the formal lessons—those came from tutors hired to make us presentable for society. Languages and history and the intricate dance of supernatural politics that I found mind-numbingly dull. No, Mother taught me the *real* skills. The ones that couldn't be found in books.

She taught me to shift.

"Feel the magic in your blood," she'd say, standing with me in the moonlit garden where jasmine grew wild and the night air tasted of possibility. "Don't force it. Don't fight it. Just... *become*."

It had taken me months to manage even a partial transformation. Weeks more to hold the shape for longer than a few heartbeats. But the first time I'd successfully shifted all the way—standing on four legs instead of two, seeing the world through a predator's eyes, feeling the power and grace of my panther form—I'd understood why Mother loved this gift so much.

In human form, I was bound by expectations. By duty. By the weight of a last name that stretched back centuries and carried responsibilities I wasn't sure I wanted.

But as a panther? I was *free*.

Mother also taught me to cook, which sounds absurd until you understand what I mean. Vampires don't eat human food for sustenance—it does nothing for us, passes through our systems without providing any real nutrition. But we can *taste*, and some foods... some foods are worth the effort for the experience alone.

"Blood pancakes," she'd announced one morning when I was fifteen, pulling me into the kitchen with a conspiratorial grin. "My mother taught me, and her mother taught her, and the recipe goes back to before we had proper names for these things."

I'd watched, fascinated, as she'd mixed dragon's blood extract—rare and expensive and slightly illegal in most territories—with flour and eggs and other mundane ingredients I barely recognized. The batter had shimmered red-gold in the morning light, and when she'd cooked them, they'd smelled like home.

"It's not about the food," she'd explained, sliding a perfectly golden pancake onto a plate. "It's about the *ritual*. About taking time to create something beautiful, even if it's fleeting. About sharing something precious with people you love." She'd met my eyes, serious now. "When you're bonded, little shadow, you'll spend lifetimes protecting your Archon. Fighting for them. Bleeding for them. Remember to also live with them. To find small joys. To make blood pancakes on quiet mornings and remind yourself that life is more than duty."

I'd eaten that pancake slowly, savoring every bite, not realizing I was learning a lesson I'd carry for two centuries.

---

My sisters were forces of nature, each one brilliant and terrifying in their own way.

Morganna, the eldest, was all strategy and cold calculation. She played the political game better than anyone I'd ever met, moving pieces across the board of supernatural society with a precision that left her enemies wondering what had hit them. Her Archon, Lord Varenthos, ruled the European Court with her at his side, and together they were *formidable*.

"You need to pay attention, Raechelle," she'd tell me during her rare visits home, her lioness eyes seeing straight through my attempts to look interested. "The politics aren't just games—they're survival. One wrong move, one alliance broken, and you could doom your Archon to death."

I'd tried. Gods, I'd tried to care about who was feuding with whom, which bloodline was ascending, which ancient grudge might explode into war. But it all felt so... *distant*. So removed from the real things that mattered.

Seraphine, the second daughter, understood me better. She was a warrior first, a diplomat second, and she'd taught me to fight before I could properly shift.

"Familiars protect," she'd said, drilling me through combat forms until my muscles screamed. "That's what we do, what we *are*. Everything else—the magic, the politics, the pretty speeches—it's all secondary to keeping your Archon alive."

She'd been bound to Damien Nightshade's older brother, a Blood Archon named Cristof who ruled vast territories in the Americas. Their bond had been the stuff of legends—partnerships so perfect it made other supernaturals jealous. Watching them together, I'd understood for the first time what the bond could be. Not servitude, but *symbiosis*. Two halves of a greater whole.

Lyssa, closest to me in age, had been my confidante and rival and best friend all rolled into one. We'd hunted together, trained together, gotten into trouble together with a frequency that gave our parents gray hairs.

"I don't want to be bound," she'd confessed to me once, when we were both young and stupid and convinced we could outrun destiny. "I want to choose my own path. See the world on my own terms. Not spend centuries in someone else's shadow."

"Then don't," I'd said, with the absolute certainty of someone who knew nothing about how the world actually worked.

She'd laughed, but it was a bitter sound. "It's not that simple, Rae. Our bloodline is *made* for this. The magic in our veins demands it. If we don't bond by our thirtieth year, the familiar power turns inward. Burns us out from the inside. We either find an Archon to bind to, or we die screaming."

I'd thought she was exaggerating. Being dramatic, as Lyssa tended to be.

I learned better.

---

The binding call came for me two weeks after my twenty-fifth birthday.

I woke one morning with the taste of blood magic on my tongue and a name I'd never heard before burning itself into my consciousness: *Damien Nightshade*.

Mother found me in the garden, clutching at my chest where something *ached*, confused and terrified by the compulsion singing through my veins.

"It's time," she said softly, and I heard the grief in her voice. "The magic has chosen your match."

"I don't understand." My hands were shaking. "I don't know anyone named Damien. I've never even been to the European territories where the Nightshades rule. How can the magic—"

"The familiar bond doesn't care about geography or logic," Mother interrupted gently. "It cares about *compatibility*. About power signatures that harmonize. About souls that can intertwine without destroying each other." She pulled me into her arms, and I could feel her trembling too. "The magic says Damien Nightshade is your match. Which means you have a choice to make."

I knew what she meant. Accept the call and travel to meet this stranger, to bind myself to him for what could be centuries or millennia. Or refuse, and let the unbonded familiar magic eat away at me until I was nothing but pain and madness and eventual death.

Some choice.

"Tell me about him," I whispered.

"He's powerful," Mother said, and I could hear her choosing words carefully. "Young for an Archon—barely a century old. Passionate. Brilliant. Dangerous in the way all Blood Archons are dangerous when they haven't learned proper control." She paused. "Seraphine speaks highly of him. Says he and Cristof are close, that Damien has a good heart beneath the typical Archon arrogance."

"And if I don't like him? If the bond..." I couldn't finish the sentence.

"Then you'll be bound to someone you don't like for a very, very long time." Mother pulled back to look at me, her expression sad but resolute. "That's the risk, little shadow. That's what I tried to prepare you for. The familiar bond is forever. Even death doesn't always break it—sometimes the grief alone is enough to kill the surviving partner."

I thought about Lyssa's words. About having no choice. About spending my entire life as someone's *familiar*, their magical complement, their protector and partner and—

"I don't want this," I said.

"I know." Mother kissed my forehead. "But the magic doesn't care what we want. It only cares what we *are*."

---

I delayed as long as I could. Days turned into weeks. The call got stronger, more insistent, until I could barely sleep without dreaming of crimson eyes and blood magic that tasted like thunderstorms. Until every morning I woke with that name on my lips: *Damien, Damien, Damien.*

Finally, Mother sat me down in her study and spoke with a bluntness that cut through my denial.

"You're killing yourself," she said. "I can smell it on you—the way the magic is turning bitter, starting to burn. You have maybe a month before the damage becomes permanent. Maybe two before it kills you." She gripped my hands. "I know you're scared. I was scared when I first bonded with your father. Every Darkpurr daughter is scared before her first binding. But you *have* to go. You have to meet him. Even if you hate him, even if the bond is miserable, at least you'll be *alive*."

So I went.

I traveled to Damien's estate in the French countryside, trying to ignore the way my heart raced as I approached, trying not to think about how my entire life was about to change. Trying not to resent the magic in my blood that had stolen my choice and decided my future without consulting me.

He was waiting in the garden when I arrived.

I'd expected arrogance. Expected a typical Archon—powerful, entitled, looking at me like I was a tool to be used rather than a person to be known. I'd steeled myself for condescension, for commands, for having to swallow my pride and my freedom all at once.

What I got instead was a young man with nervous hands and kind eyes who took one look at me and said, "You don't want to be here."

It wasn't a question.

"No," I admitted, too surprised to lie. "I don't."

"Neither do I," he said, and I heard the truth in it. "I didn't ask for a familiar. Didn't want the responsibility of someone else's life bound to mine. I've been putting off the bonding ritual for years because the thought of..." He gestured helplessly. "I'm barely capable of managing my own existence. How am I supposed to be responsible for yours too?"

We stared at each other for a long moment. Then, impossibly, we both laughed.

"This is absurd," I said.

"Completely absurd," he agreed. Then, more seriously: "But the magic doesn't give us much choice, does it?"

"No," I said quietly. "It really doesn't."

He held out his hand. "Damien Nightshade. Reluctant Blood Archon, mediocre violinist, and apparently your destined match. I promise to try very hard not to get us both killed."

I took his hand, feeling the familiar magic surge at the contact, and something in my chest *relaxed*. "Raechelle Darkpurr. Reluctant familiar, decent huntress, and equally determined to survive this. I promise to try very hard not to murder you in your sleep."

"That's fair," he said solemnly. Then he grinned, and I saw the passion Mother had mentioned, the brilliance, the barely-contained power that made Blood Archons both magnificent and dangerous. "So. Shall we figure out how to do this whole bonding thing without completely losing ourselves?"

"Yes," I said, and meant it. "Let's."

---

The bonding ritual itself was beautiful and terrifying in equal measure.

It happened under a full moon, in a sacred grove that had been used for familiar bindings for thousands of years. Damien and I stood facing each other, with Seraphine and Cristof as witnesses, and spoke the ancient words that would tie our souls together.

"I offer my blood," Damien said, slicing his palm and holding it out.

"I offer my essence," I responded, doing the same.

Our hands clasped, blood mixing, and the magic *exploded*.

I felt him rush into me—his power, his emotions, his very *self* pouring through the bond we were creating. Felt his fear and determination and the fierce protective instinct he'd been trying to hide. Felt his loneliness, gods, the crushing loneliness of someone who'd been powerful and isolated his entire life. Felt his desperate hope that maybe, just maybe, this could work.

And I felt him feeling *me*. My wildness, my resentment, my terror at losing myself. My love for my family, for hunting, for the simple joy of running through forests under the moon. My determination to survive this with my soul intact. My cautious, budding hope that maybe he wasn't so bad after all.

When the magic finally settled, we were changed. Still ourselves, but also... *more*. I could feel him like a second heartbeat, could sense his emotions as if they were my own. When I looked at him, I saw not just a Blood Archon, but my Archon. Mine to protect, mine to serve, mine to—

"This is incredibly strange," Damien said, and I felt his wonder through our bond.

"Incredibly," I agreed, still adjusting to the sensation of being two people in one skin.

Seraphine smiled at us from where she stood with Cristof. "It gets easier," she promised. "The bond feels overwhelming at first, but you'll learn to modulate it. To give each other privacy. To be individuals who choose to be together rather than just... merged."

"How long does that take?" I asked.

"Depends on the pair." Cristof's voice was warm with amusement. "Some take decades. Seraphine and I managed it in about six months."

"Show-offs," Damien muttered, but there was affection in it.

And so began my life as a familiar.

---

They were good years, those decades with Damien.

Not perfect—how could they be, when we'd both been forced into something neither wanted? But good. He was kind where other Archons were cruel. Patient when I struggled with the bond's demands. Willing to see me as a partner rather than a possession.

We learned each other. Learned to fight together, to trust each other, to find joy in small moments between the larger demands of his position. He taught me about blood magic, about the intricate politics that governed supernatural society. I taught him to hunt properly, to appreciate silence, to make Mother's blood pancakes when the weight of responsibility got too heavy.

"You saved me," he told me once, years into our bond. "I was drowning before you came. The power, the expectations, the constant political maneuvering—I was so alone. But you..." He'd pulled me close, resting his forehead against mine. "You make it bearable. Make me want to be better than I am."

"You do the same for me," I'd admitted. Because it was true. The wild, restless girl I'd been had found purpose in protecting him. Had found that duty didn't have to be a cage—sometimes it could be an anchor.

I thought we'd have centuries together. Thought I'd spend my long life at his side, growing old in the way familiars do—slowly, gracefully, our powers intertwined until we were two halves of the same soul.

I was wrong.

---

It happened at a political gathering, the kind of tedious event I'd learned to tolerate for Damien's sake. Representatives from a dozen different bloodlines, all posturing and pretending to be civil while plotting each other's downfalls.

I felt the poison before I understood what it meant.

One moment, Damien was beside me, laughing at something Lord Varenthos had said. The next, our bond was *screaming*, and I felt him stumbling, felt his power going haywire as something foreign invaded his system.

"Damien!" I caught him as he fell, my hands already glowing with the familiar magic that let me channel and stabilize his power. But this was different. This wasn't a magical attack I could counter. This was *poison*—specifically designed to kill Blood Archons, to shut down their powers from the inside out.

"Raechelle," he gasped, and through our bond I felt his terror. Not for himself—he'd already accepted he was dying. For *me*. For what losing him would do to me. "The bond—you need to—"

"No." The word ripped from my throat. "No, you're not dying. I won't let you. I'll find the antidote, I'll—"

"There isn't one." His hand cupped my face, and I could feel his life draining away through our connection. "Listen to me. When I die... the bond will try to take you with me. You have to fight it. Have to survive—"

"I can't." The truth of it crashed over me. "Damien, I can't. The bond is too strong, we're too intertwined, I—"

"You *can*." His eyes held mine, fierce even as the light dimmed behind them. "You're the strongest person I know. You'll grieve. Gods, you'll grieve so hard it might break you. But you'll *survive*. Promise me."

I couldn't speak. Could only hold him as the poison worked faster, could only feel our bond starting to fray at the edges, could only watch the man who'd been my partner for forty-three years slip away from me.

"Promise me," he insisted, using the last of his strength to grip my hand. "Live, Raechelle. Find another Archon if you can. Or find a way to break the familiar magic if you can't. But *live*. Don't let my death be the end of your story."

"I promise," I choked out, lying through my teeth because what else could I do?

He smiled, and I felt his love through our dying bond—fierce and absolute and heartbreaking. "Liar," he whispered. "But I love you for trying."

Then he was gone.

And I *screamed*.

---

They say the death of a bonded Archon always kills their familiar. That the bond, severed violently, creates a backlash that stops the familiar's heart.

They're mostly right.

I felt it—the pull of death, the bond trying to drag me after Damien into the dark. Felt my heart stutter, felt my magic fracturing, felt everything I was starting to *break* under the weight of his absence.

But I'd made a promise. And Darkpurr women keep their promises, even ones they never intended to honor.

I fought.

Gods, how I fought. Clawed my way back from the edge of death with nothing but pure stubborn will and the memory of Damien's last words. Felt my magic tear itself apart and rebuild in new patterns, adapting to survive without him. Felt something fundamental in me *change*, becoming less than I was but also somehow more.

When I woke—three days later, according to Seraphine who'd stayed by my bedside—I was alive. Broken, grieving, fundamentally altered on a level I couldn't articulate. But *alive*.

"You survived," Seraphine said, and I heard the wonder in her voice. "Raechelle, you survived a bonded death. That's... no one survives that."

"I promised him," I whispered, and started crying.

I cried for weeks. Mourned for months. Spent years learning to exist with a hole in my soul where Damien had been, learning to be just Raechelle again instead of Raechelle-and-Damien, learning that survival wasn't the same as living.

The familiar magic eventually stopped burning—the bond's severance had somehow reset it, giving me a second chance I'd never expected. But I swore I'd never bond again. Never let myself be that vulnerable. Never love someone so much that losing them could nearly kill me.

I swore a lot of things, in those grief-darkened years.

I broke most of those promises eventually.

---

The years after Damien blurred together. I wandered. Took odd jobs protecting lesser vampires who couldn't afford proper guards. Tried to find purpose in a life that suddenly felt directionless.

Eventually, Seraphine found me in a bar in Prague, drunk on inferior wine and contemplating whether I wanted to see the next century.

"Mother's worried," she said, sliding into the seat across from me.

"Mother's always worried," I replied. "It's her default state."

"She's worried because you're *dying*, Rae. Not from poison or violence, but from having nothing to live *for*." Seraphine's hand covered mine. "The familiar magic is restless again. You survived severing the bond with Damien, but the magic itself... it needs purpose. Needs an Archon to protect, or it turns inward."

"I'm not bonding again." My voice was flat. Final.

"Then find another way to give the magic purpose." She pulled out a file, slid it across the table. "The Sixxx bloodline. American Blood Archons, powerful but paranoid. They've been seeking a familiar guardian for their line—not a bonded familiar, but a *bloodline* guardian. Someone to watch over the family itself, protect them from a distance, ensure the line continues."

"That's not how familiar magic works," I said, but I was already opening the file.

"It's not how it *usually* works," Seraphine corrected. "But you're not usual anymore. You survived a bonded death, Rae. Your magic has changed. Adapted. It might be able to adapt to this too—a more distant connection, spread across a bloodline rather than concentrated on a single Archon."

I looked at the file. At the Sixxx family tree, spanning centuries. At the current matriarch, Elara Sixxx, and her husband Marcus. At their newborn son, Riven.

"Why would they want this?" I asked. "Why not a traditional bonding?"

"Because they're smart enough to know enemies will target a bonded familiar." Seraphine's voice was grim. "They want protection without the liability. Someone who can watch from the shadows, intervene when needed, but won't be an obvious target."

It was everything I'd sworn I didn't want. Another form of bondage, another commitment, another way to lose myself in service to others.

But looking at that baby's photo—Riven Sixxx, barely a month old, already carrying the weight of an ancient bloodline—I felt something I hadn't felt in years.

Purpose.

"I'll need to meet them," I heard myself say. "Elara and Marcus. If I'm doing this, it's on my terms."

Seraphine smiled. "I'll arrange it."

---

The ritual to bind me to the Sixxx bloodline was nothing like bonding with Damien.

There was no rush of emotions, no overwhelming merge of souls. Instead, it was subtle—a thread of magic connecting me to the family's blood, to their legacy, to their future. I could sense them but not feel them. Could protect them without being consumed by them.

It was perfect. Or at least, as close to perfect as I could manage.

"You'll watch over them?" Elara asked, holding baby Riven against her chest like she was afraid I might steal him. "All of them, but especially him?"

"I'll guard your bloodline," I promised. "From a distance, as we agreed. You might never see me. Might not even know I'm there. But I'll make sure your family survives."

"Why?" Marcus asked, and I respected him for the bluntness. "Why commit to this? Seraphine says you lost your bonded Archon. Why take on another burden?"

I looked at Riven, sleeping peacefully in his mother's arms, completely unaware of the world he'd been born into. Thought about Damien's last words. About promises and survival and finding reasons to keep going.

"Because I made a promise to keep living," I said quietly. "And I need something to live *for*."

So I became the Sixxx bloodline's shadow guardian. Watched as Riven grew from infant to child to teenager, always from a distance. Intervened when necessary—a rival's curse deflected here, an assassin intercepted there, a "lucky break" that was actually me clearing obstacles from his path. 

I watched him become brilliant, passionate, kind in ways that reminded me painfully of Damien. Watched Elara and Marcus love him fiercely, prepare him for a heritage he didn't fully understand.

And when that blood moon rose and Terravos's earth spikes tore them away from him, when his power awakened in the worst possible way, when the distant thread of magic suddenly flared into something *more*—

I ran.

Ran to him like my life depended on it, because maybe it did. Ran to fulfill the oath I'd made to his parents, to honor Damien's memory by not letting another good person be destroyed by this brutal supernatural world.

Ran toward my future, though I didn't know it yet.

Because Riven Sixxx—grieving, powerful, completely unprepared for what he was—would become so much more than a charge to protect. He would become my partner, my Archon, my *love*. He would give me back everything I'd lost when Damien died, and more besides.

He would give me back my life.

But standing in that cabin, looking at him unconscious and vulnerable and reeking of newly awakened power, I didn't know any of that yet. I just knew I had a job to do. A bloodline to protect. A young man who needed me even if he didn't know it.

I gathered him carefully, feeling the familiar magic stirring in ways it hadn't since Damien. Trying not to think about how dangerous that was. Trying not to hope.

"I've got you," I whispered to his sleeping form. "I've got you, and I'm not letting go."

It was a promise.

One I intended to keep.

This time, I wouldn't fail. This time, I would be strong enough, smart enough, *careful* enough to keep my Archon safe.

This time, maybe the story could have a different ending.

---

Two hundred and forty-seven years.

That's how long I'd been alive when Riven Sixxx stumbled into my world covered in grief and power. Two centuries of life and loss and learning to survive what should have killed me.

I'd been a wild daughter of the Darkpurr clan. A reluctant familiar. A grieving widow in every way that mattered. A shadow guardian watching from a distance.

I'd been so many things, played so many roles, survived so many versions of myself.

But looking at Riven as I drove him home that first night, feeling the proto-bond between us singing with possibility, I realized I was about to become something new.

Someone's partner again. Someone's protector. Someone's—

I didn't let myself finish that thought. It was too soon, too dangerous, too much like hope.

But the seed was planted. And as any Darkpurr daughter could tell you, once something takes root, it's almost impossible to kill.

My name is Raechelle Darkpurr. I'm a familiar to the Sixxx bloodline. And this is where my story *really* begins.

Everything else was just prologue.
