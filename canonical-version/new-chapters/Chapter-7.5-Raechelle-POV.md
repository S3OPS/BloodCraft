# **Chapter 7.5 - Raechelle's Perspective: On the Eve of Forever**

*[Raechelle POV - The night before the bonding ritual]*

---

The full moon would rise tomorrow night, and I was terrified.

I stood at the window of Riven's childhood home, looking out over the darkened woods that bordered his property, and tried to remember the last time I'd felt this particular cocktail of emotions. Fear. Hope. Desire. *Love*. It had been... gods, it had been over a century. And even then, it hadn't felt like *this*.

Behind me, I could hear Riven moving around in his room, preparing for bed after another grueling day of training. Ten days. We'd had ten days together—ten days to prepare him for what was coming, to teach him about his heritage, to build the foundation of the bond that would either save us both or destroy me completely.

Ten days to fall hopelessly, irrevocably in love with him.

I pressed my forehead against the cool glass, closing my eyes. This wasn't supposed to happen. I was supposed to be professional, distant, *safe*. I was supposed to guide him, train him, protect him—not ache for him with every fiber of my being.

But Riven Sixxx had somehow slipped past every defense I'd built in two centuries of life.

It wasn't just his scent, though gods knew that alone was enough to drive me to distraction. Blood Archons always smelled good to their familiars—it was part of the bond, part of the ancient magic that tied our kinds together. But Riven... Riven smelled like *home*. Like safety and passion and everything I'd been missing for the past two hundred and forty-seven years without even knowing it.

It wasn't just his power, though feeling it grow stronger every day made my familiar instincts purr with satisfaction. He was *strong*—stronger than Elara had been at his age, stronger than Marcus ever was. The potential in him was staggering, and watching him learn to control it, watching him transform from confused college student to confident Blood Archon, had been one of the most rewarding experiences of my long life.

It wasn't even just his body, though I'd be lying if I said I hadn't noticed. The awakening had changed him, sculpting muscle and power into his frame in ways that made my mouth go dry. Every training session was sweet torture, watching him move, watching sweat bead on his skin, watching that fierce concentration on his face as he mastered each new technique.

No, what undid me completely was *him*. His kindness despite his grief. His determination despite his fear. The way he looked at me—not as a servant or a tool, but as a *woman*. As someone precious. As someone he was choosing, not because ancient bonds demanded it, but because he wanted to.

"You call me sir," he'd said that first night, his voice full of wonder, "but I feel like I should be calling you that."

Such a small moment. Such a simple observation. But it had cracked something open inside me, some wall I'd built around my heart to keep it safe from exactly this kind of pain.

Because tomorrow night, under the full moon, we would complete the bonding ritual. And if I wasn't careful—if I let myself feel too much, want too much, *need* too much—I would lose myself completely in him.

I'd explained the ritual to him earlier today, watching his face as he processed what it meant. The ceremony. The exchange of blood and essence. The physical union required to seal the bond. I'd tried to keep my voice steady, professional, like I was explaining any other aspect of his heritage.

But inside, I was screaming.

Because I wanted it. Gods help me, I wanted it so badly I could barely breathe. I wanted to be his in every way the bond allowed. I wanted to feel his power merge with mine, wanted to taste his blood on my tongue, wanted to know every inch of him in the most intimate ways possible.

I wanted, and wanting terrified me.

A soft knock on the doorframe made me turn. Riven stood there, barefoot and beautiful in sleep pants and a t-shirt that hugged his newly muscled frame. His dark hair was still damp from the shower, falling across his forehead in a way that made my fingers itch to brush it back.

"Can't sleep?" he asked, his voice soft with concern.

I smiled, trying to keep it light. "Old habits. I don't need as much sleep as humans do."

He crossed the room to stand beside me at the window, close enough that I could feel the heat radiating from his skin, smell the clean scent of soap mixed with his natural musk. Close enough to touch, if I dared.

"Are you nervous?" he asked. "About tomorrow?"

*Terrified,* I wanted to say. *Desperate. Hopeful. So in love with you it hurts.*

"A bit," I admitted instead. "It's been a very long time since I've bonded with anyone. The last Blood Archon I was bound to was... centuries ago."

That was a lie, but only technically. I'd been bound to the Sixxx line for generations, but it had been a distant thing, a hereditary connection maintained through ritual and duty rather than the kind of deep, soul-binding connection we were about to create.

"Tell me about them," Riven said, settling into the chair near the window. "Your previous charge."

I hesitated, then took the chair opposite his. This felt dangerous—talking about the past, about the hearts I'd known and lost. But maybe he needed to hear it. Maybe I needed to say it.

"His name was Damien Nightshade," I began, and even after all these years, the name still brought a bittersweet ache. "He was a Blood Archon from the European line, powerful and passionate and absolutely convinced he was invincible."

"What happened to him?"

"He was murdered," I said bluntly. "By a rival who poisoned him at a political gathering. I felt him die through our bond." I met Riven's eyes, needing him to understand. "That's the danger of the familiar bond, Riven. We feel everything you feel. Your pain becomes our pain. Your death..." I had to pause, had to breathe through the memory. "Your death would shatter us."

He was quiet for a long moment. Then: "Is that why you're afraid? Because you think I'll die like he did?"

"No." The word came out more vehemently than I intended. "No, Riven. You're not Damien. You're stronger, smarter, more careful. And I—" I stopped, unsure how much to reveal.

"You what?"

"I won't let you die," I said fiercely. "I've spent my entire life preparing for you, protecting your line, waiting for this moment. I won't lose you the way I lost him. I *can't*."

He reached across the space between us, taking my hand in his. His touch sent shivers up my arm, made the proto-bond between us pulse with warmth.

"I'm not planning on dying anytime soon," he said with a small smile. "Especially not now that I have you."

*Have me.* Such simple words. Such devastating words.

"Riven..." I started, then stopped, unsure what I even wanted to say.

"I know tomorrow is a big deal," he continued, his thumb stroking absently over my knuckles in a way that made my breath catch. "I know it's... intimate. I want you to know that I'm not taking this lightly. I'm not seeing this as just some magical ritual we have to complete." His gray eyes met mine, and the intensity in them made my heart stutter. "I care about you, Raechelle. More than I probably should after only ten days. More than might be wise, given everything. But I do."

Oh gods. Oh gods, he couldn't say things like that. Couldn't look at me like that. Couldn't make me *hope*.

"You're feeling the bond pulling at you," I said, trying to inject reason into a situation that had left reason behind days ago. "The familiar connection creates... attraction. Desire. It's natural, but—"

"Don't," he interrupted gently. "Don't diminish this by blaming it on magic. Yes, I feel the bond. Yes, I can sense this... this *pull* between us. But I also have eyes, Raechelle. And a heart. And a brain that works perfectly well when it's not being scrambled by your presence."

He stood, tugging me up with him until we were standing chest to chest, his free hand coming up to cup my face.

"I see you," he said softly. "Not just as my familiar or my teacher or my protector. I see *you*. The woman who's been patient with me when I was difficult. Who's been strong when I was falling apart. Who makes me laugh even when everything feels impossible. Who's beautiful and fierce and slightly terrifying in the best possible way."

I couldn't breathe. Couldn't think. Could only stand there, trembling, as this man—this *boy*, really, compared to my centuries—said everything I'd been desperate to hear and terrified to want.

"Tomorrow," he continued, "when we complete the ritual, I'm not just binding myself to you because I have to. I'm choosing you. I'm choosing *this*." His forehead touched mine, and I could feel his breath on my lips. "If you'll have me."

*If I'll have him.* As if there was any question. As if I hadn't already given him my heart without even realizing it was happening.

"Riven," I whispered, and his name felt like a prayer. "I've lived for two hundred and forty-seven years. I've seen empires rise and fall. I've loved and lost and learned to guard my heart carefully. But you..." I pulled back just enough to see his eyes. "You've undone me in ten days. You've made me feel things I thought I'd forgotten how to feel. You've made me *hope*, and that's the most dangerous thing of all."

"Hope for what?"

"For everything," I admitted. "For a future that's more than just duty and protection. For a bond that's built on more than ancient magic. For..." I hesitated, then took the leap. "For love. Real, genuine, terrifying love."

His smile was like the sunrise, bright and warm and full of promise. "Then tomorrow isn't just a bonding ritual."

"No," I agreed, my own smile answering his. "Tomorrow is a promise. A choice. A—"

"A beginning," he finished.

He kissed me then, soft and sweet and full of tenderness that made my ancient heart swell. It wasn't the passionate, desperate kiss we'd shared during training earlier in the week. This was different. This was a promise, just as he'd said. A vow that tomorrow would mean something beyond magical necessity.

When we finally pulled apart, I rested my head against his chest, listening to the strong, steady beat of his heart.

"I'm still terrified," I confessed.

"Me too," he admitted. "But I think... I think the best things in life are probably terrifying. Otherwise, they wouldn't be worth having."

Wise words from someone so young. Or perhaps not so young—perhaps old enough in the ways that mattered.

We stood there for a long time, wrapped in each other's arms, neither of us wanting to break the moment. Outside, the moon was waxing toward fullness, preparing for tomorrow's ritual. Inside, my heart was preparing too—not for duty or obligation, but for something infinitely more precious and infinitely more dangerous.

Love.

True, bone-deep, soul-binding love.

And for the first time in two centuries, I wasn't afraid of it. I was ready to embrace it, to dive into it, to let it transform me the way Riven's awakening had transformed him.

Tomorrow, under the full moon, we would complete the ritual that bound familiar to Archon.

But tonight—tonight we were just Raechelle and Riven, two souls choosing each other against all odds, against all logic, against every defense I'd ever built.

And it was terrifying.

And it was perfect.

"Get some sleep," I whispered against his chest. "Tomorrow's a big day."

"Will you stay?" he asked. "Not... not in my bed," he added quickly, adorably flustered. "Just... in the house. Close. I sleep better when I can feel you nearby."

My heart melted completely. "Always," I promised. "I'll always be close."

And I meant it. Not because the bond demanded it. Not because duty required it.

But because I loved him.

And tomorrow, I would show him exactly what that meant.
