# **Chapter 34.5 - Raechelle's Perspective: The Anchor Holds**

*[Raechelle POV - During Riven's final duel with Terravos at the Heart of Stone]*

---

The Heart of Stone nexus point pulsed with elemental power so intense it made my familiar senses scream in protest. I stood at the head of the rescue team—twenty-three warriors I'd personally selected from over a hundred volunteers—and watched Riven walk into the ritual circle to face Terravos alone.

Every instinct I had was screaming at me to follow him. To *not* let him face this threat without me at his side. But the plan required us to split our focus: Riven dueling Terravos while we rescued the imprisoned Blood Archon from the containment fortress.

Strategic. Necessary. Absolutely the right tactical decision.

I hated it with every fiber of my being.

*I can feel you panicking.* Riven's voice through our bond was steady, calmer than I felt. *Breathe, love. I've got this.*

*You're about to fight an Earth Archon who's been planning this confrontation for decades. On his chosen ground. At a nexus point that amplifies his power. You do NOT "got this."*

I felt his amusement through our connection, warm and steady and absolutely infuriating given the circumstances.

*I have you,* he sent back. *As long as you're alive and bonded to me, I'm never truly alone in a fight. Remember? That's what you told me six months ago.*

He was right, damn him. The familiar bond didn't just connect us emotionally—it was a *channel*. I could send him strength, power, focus. Could act as his anchor when his own magic threatened to spiral out of control. Could be the steady presence that kept him grounded when everything else was chaos.

But to do that, I had to *trust* him to handle Terravos alone. Had to believe that the brilliant, powerful, frustratingly stubborn man I loved was strong enough to survive this.

Had to have faith.

"Team leaders, sound off," I commanded, forcing my attention back to the task at hand. If I couldn't be with Riven, I could at least accomplish our secondary objective and give him one less thing to worry about.

"Strike team one, ready." Viktor's growl came through the communication crystal, his werewolf pack positioned to breach the western wall.

"Strike team two, in position." Morgana's voice was crisp, her coven's shields already shimmering around the eastern approach.

"Support team, standing by." Cassius Velthorne, vampire lord and unlikely ally, commanded our reserves with centuries of military experience.

"Then let's move," I said. "Operation begins now. Riven—"

*I know.* His voice through our bond was filled with love and confidence and just a hint of fear he was trying to hide. *Go save an heir, Raechelle. I'll handle the egomaniacal Earth Archon trying to end the world. See you on the other side.*

*You better,* I sent back, layering it with all the emotion I couldn't afford to voice aloud. *Because if you die on me, I'm going to be very upset.*

*Wouldn't dream of it.* A pause, then, softer: *I love you.*

*I love you too. Now go show Terravos why you're the most terrifying Blood Archon this world has seen in generations.*

I felt him smile through our bond, felt him drawing strength from our connection even as he turned to face his enemy. And then I forced myself to move, to lead my team toward the fortress, to trust that the man I loved would survive the next hour.

The containment fortress was exactly as our intelligence had described: a squat, brutal structure carved from solid stone and reinforced with elemental magic that made my skin crawl. It was designed to hold an Archon prisoner—which meant it was designed to withstand almost anything we could throw at it.

Almost.

"Morgana, start the counter-working," I ordered. "Viktor, have your pack ready to breach the moment the shields drop. Cassius, I want your forces watching our backs. Terravos might have guards, and I don't want surprises."

The teams moved with practiced efficiency, and I felt a surge of pride in these warriors who'd volunteered for this suicide mission. Because that's what it was, really. We were attacking a fortified position on an active battlefield where an Archon duel was taking place. The mortality rate for this kind of operation was historically around sixty percent.

They'd volunteered anyway.

Because they believed in Riven. In his vision of a better supernatural world. In the young Blood Archon who'd united Archons and built coalitions and convinced them that cooperation was possible.

*Focus,* I reminded myself. *Save the inspirational thoughts for after everyone's survived.*

Through our bond, I felt Riven engage with Terravos. Felt the collision of blood magic and earth magic, two elemental forces meeting in a clash that made the ground beneath us tremble. Felt his initial strategy—testing Terravos's defenses, looking for weaknesses, staying mobile.

Good. He was fighting smart, not recklessly. I'd drilled defensive tactics into him for months specifically for this moment.

"Shields are down!" Morgana called out. "Breach now!"

Viktor's pack hit the entrance like a battering ram made of fur and fury. Stone cracked. Wards shattered. And we poured through the gap into the fortress interior, ready for anything.

What we found made my blood run cold.

The imprisoned Blood Archon—a woman named Seraphine, according to our intelligence—hung suspended in a cage made of pure elemental energy. Her body was emaciated, drained by whatever ritual Terravos had been using to siphon her power. But her eyes... gods, her eyes were still *alive*. Still fierce. Still fighting.

"Get her down," I ordered. "Carefully. If this is booby-trapped—"

The fortress shook. Hard. Stone rained from the ceiling, and through our bond I felt Riven's sudden spike of pain.

*Riven?* I sent urgently. *What happened?*

*Terravos is stronger than we thought.* His voice was strained, breathless. *He's drawing power directly from the nexus. I need to cut him off from his power source, but—*

Another tremor. More pain. I felt blood—*his* blood—and rage threatened to overwhelm my tactical thinking.

*Stay focused,* I sent, even as I wanted to abandon the mission and run to his side. *Remember the plan. Sever his connection. You can do this.*

*Getting hit pretty hard here, love. Could use some of that anchor support you're always talking about.*

He was asking me to channel power to him. Through our bond, across the distance separating us. It was possible—the familiar bond allowed for that kind of magical transfer—but it would leave me vulnerable. Distracted. Unable to lead the rescue team effectively.

I didn't hesitate.

*Viktor,* I snapped. "Take command. Get Seraphine down and out. I'm supporting Riven."

"Raechelle—"

"That's an order!" I was already moving to a clear space, already reaching for the bond, already *opening* myself to channel power to my Archon. "Complete the mission. I'll handle—"

The world exploded into sensation as I connected fully to Riven's consciousness. Suddenly I could see what he saw: Terravos, massive and terrible, his body half-merged with the stone itself. Could feel what he felt: exhaustion, pain, determination. Could sense what he sensed: the nexus power flowing into Terravos like a river, making him nearly invincible.

*There,* I sent, using my centuries of experience to analyze what his younger perspective might miss. *The connection to the nexus—it's not distributed evenly. There's a focal point. Right side, near his chest. That's where he's channeling the power.*

I felt Riven's surge of understanding, felt him adjusting his strategy. And then I *pushed*, sending familiar magic flooding through our bond. Not attacking power—supporting power. The kind that made him stronger, faster, more resilient. The kind that let an heir fight beyond his normal limits because he wasn't fighting alone.

Riven moved like lightning, blood magic crystallizing into that blade technique he'd perfected over months of practice. The strike was surgical, precise, aimed exactly where I'd indicated.

It connected.

Terravos *screamed*, a sound that shook the fortress and probably rattled windows in Nocturne miles away. The nexus connection severed, power bleeding away, his advantage suddenly gone.

*Now!* I urged. *While he's weakened! Hit him with everything!*

What happened next was difficult to describe, even experiencing it through our bond. Riven didn't just attack—he *commanded*. Blood magic erupted from him in patterns I'd never seen, techniques he'd been developing in secret, power shaped by both instinct and training into something absolutely devastating.

Terravos tried to defend. Tried to reconnect to the nexus. Tried to bring his centuries of experience to bear against this upstart who dared challenge him.

It wasn't enough.

Through our bond, I felt the exact moment Riven's blade found Terravos's heart. Felt the Earth Archon's shock as he realized he'd *lost*. Felt ancient power dissipate as one of the oldest Archons in existence finally met his end.

And then, suddenly, *quiet*.

The fortress stopped shaking. The oppressive weight of elemental magic lifted. Through our bond, I felt Riven's exhaustion, his disbelief, his slowly building realization that he'd actually *won*.

"Raechelle!" Viktor's voice pulled me back to my own body, my own mission. "We've got Seraphine. She's weak but alive. We need to move *now* before this whole place comes down."

I blinked, reorienting myself, and realized with shock that the fortress was indeed beginning to collapse. Without Terravos's power maintaining it, the structure was returning to its natural state: rubble.

"Everyone out!" I commanded. "Cassius, have your vampires carry anyone who can't run. We leave *no one* behind!"

The extraction was chaos—pure, adrenaline-fueled chaos as we raced through crumbling corridors with a half-dead Archon and a fortress trying to bury us alive. But we made it. Every single member of my team emerged into the desert sunlight, exhausted and battered but *alive*.

Twenty-three warriors had volunteered.

Twenty-three warriors came home.

*Riven?* I sent through our bond, urgent now that our immediate danger had passed. *Status report. Please tell me you're alive and intact.*

*Alive.* His voice was exhausted, drained, but wonderful to hear. *Mostly intact. Terravos is dead. It's over, Raechelle. It's actually over.*

The relief that flooded through me was so intense it nearly buckled my knees. He was alive. He'd won. We'd succeeded in both objectives.

Against all odds, against every historical precedent, against the overwhelming power of an Earth Archon who'd been planning this confrontation for decades—we'd won.

"Is he—?" Morgana started to ask, seeing my expression.

"He's alive," I confirmed, and saw relief ripple through the assembled warriors. "Terravos is dead. The immediate threat is over."

The cheer that went up was deafening, warriors from three different species celebrating a victory that had seemed impossible just hours ago.

But I barely heard it. Was already moving, already running toward the ritual circle where Riven had fought his duel, needing to *see* him with my own eyes, to hold him, to confirm he was truly safe.

I found him standing in the center of the circle, covered in dust and blood—most of it not his own, thankfully—staring down at Terravos's body with an expression I couldn't quite read.

"Riven." My voice was soft, not wanting to startle him.

He turned, and the moment his eyes met mine, something in him broke. The warrior facade crumbled, and suddenly he was just a young man who'd just killed someone to protect his world, his people, his *love*.

I was there in an instant, pulling him into my arms, letting him shake with reaction and adrenaline crash. "I've got you," I murmured against his hair. "It's okay. You're okay. We're okay."

"I killed him." Riven's voice was hoarse, uncertain. "I actually killed him. The Archon who murdered my parents, who threatened everyone I love, who tried to end the world—and I just... I killed him."

"You did." I pulled back enough to meet his eyes. "You did what needed to be done. What *only* you could do. You saved countless lives today, Riven. Probably saved the entire supernatural world."

"So why do I feel so..." He gestured helplessly, unable to find words.

"Hollow? Conflicted? Like revenge didn't actually fix anything?" I cupped his face in my hands. "Because you're a good person, love. Because you understand that taking a life—even a life that needed to be taken—has weight. Has cost. That's not weakness. That's *wisdom*."

Through our bond, I could feel him processing, working through the complex emotions that came after combat, after victory, after achieving the goal that had driven him for nearly two years.

"What happens now?" he asked finally.

I smiled, despite everything. "Now? Now we go home. We heal. We process. We figure out what kind of world we want to build now that Terravos isn't trying to destroy it. We live, Riven. We finally get to *live*."

"Together."

"Always together," I confirmed. "That's the deal, remember? You're stuck with me for the duration. Familiar bond is pretty much forever."

"Good." He leaned his forehead against mine, and through our connection I felt love and gratitude and relief and hope all tangled together. "I wouldn't want it any other way."

Around us, the desert stretched out in all directions, beautiful and harsh and full of possibility. Behind us, our allies were already starting the long journey back to Nocturne. Ahead of us, an uncertain future that we'd have to navigate together.

But right now, in this moment, holding the man I loved after watching him achieve the impossible, I allowed myself to simply *feel*.

Pride. Joy. Relief. Hope. Love.

So much love it felt like it might overflow through our bond and spill out into the desert itself.

We'd done it. Against all odds, against every historical precedent, against the combined power of an ancient Archon and his army—we'd won.

And now, finally, we could start building the life we'd been fighting for.

The life my charge deserved.

The life we'd earned together, through blood and magic and unwavering partnership.

Our life.

Together.

Always.
