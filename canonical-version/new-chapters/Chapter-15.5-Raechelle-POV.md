# **Chapter 15.5 - Raechelle's Perspective: When Darkness Descends**

*[Raechelle POV - During the attack at the Crimson Ball]*

---

The moment the earth elementals breached the Grand Hall, every instinct I'd honed over two centuries screamed at me to *protect*.

One second, I'd been standing beside Riven, watching him navigate the treacherous waters of supernatural politics with a grace that made my heart swell with pride. The next, the floor was cracking, stone creatures were erupting from beneath the polished marble, and the screaming began.

But all I could focus on was *him*.

My Archon. My bond-mate. My *love*.

"Raechelle!" His voice cut through the chaos, sharp with command and concern. "The Council—help evacuate—"

"*No.*" The word tore from my throat, primal and absolute. Through our bond, I felt his surprise at my vehemence, but I didn't care. "I'm not leaving you."

An earth elemental—seven feet of animated stone and Terravos's malice—lunged toward us. I shifted before conscious thought, my human form flowing into panther in the space of a heartbeat. My claws met stone with a screech that set teeth on edge, but I'd spent centuries learning to fight creatures far harder than myself. I went for the eyes—every creature needed to see, even magical constructs—and felt savage satisfaction when my claws found purchase and the elemental stumbled back, temporarily blinded.

*Good.* Let them all see what happened when they threatened mine.

"Raechelle!" Riven's hands were suddenly on me—on my panther form—pulling me back as another elemental's fist smashed the floor where I'd been standing a second before. "I need you to coordinate—"

"I need you to *live*," I snarled, shifting back to human just long enough to meet his eyes. The bond between us was singing with our combined fear and fury, our powers feeding off each other in a way that made my skin prickle with supernatural energy. "You want to help evacuate? Fine. But I'm staying with you."

I saw the argument forming on his lips, saw him weighing duty against desire, responsibility against our bond. Saw the exact moment he made his decision.

"Together, then," he said, and gods help me, I loved him even more for understanding.

The next few minutes were a blur of violence and blood. Riven's power blazed through our bond like a second sun, and I channeled it, shaped it, directed it with the precision of someone who'd been training for exactly this moment for lifetimes. He had the raw power; I had the experience. Together, we were *devastating*.

An elemental charged Lady Seraphina, its stone fists raised to crush. Riven's blood magic wrapped around it like crimson chains, immobilizing it mid-stride. I shifted and leaped, using the creature's own frozen body as a springboard to reach the vampire councilor and pull her to safety.

"Get to the emergency exits," I commanded her, already turning back to find Riven. "We'll hold them—"

"Raechelle, left!" Riven's shout came through both our bond and the air, giving me a split-second warning before stone fingers grabbed for my ankle. I twisted, shifted, felt the claws scrape my fur instead of crushing my bone. Landed on all fours and sprang back toward Riven, toward *safety*, toward the only place that mattered.

Through our bond, I felt him reaching for me even as he deflected another elemental's attack. Felt his fear—not for himself, never for himself, but for *me*. Felt the way his power surged when I was threatened, the way his control wavered when he thought I might be hurt.

*Focus,* I sent through our bond, layering it with love and reassurance and absolute confidence. *I'm fine. We're fine. Just stay close.*

*Always,* came his response, fierce and immediate. *I'm not losing you.*

And there it was—the thing I'd been most afraid of when we'd first bonded. Not that I would lose him, though that terror was ever-present. But that he would be so concerned with protecting me that he'd leave himself vulnerable.

Love was a weakness in battle. I'd learned that lesson the hard way with Damien, watching him die while trying to reach me. I'd sworn I'd never let it happen again.

But with Riven, I was learning that love could also be a *strength*.

Because when he fought, he wasn't fighting alone. He had me—my experience, my power, my unflinching support through our bond. And when I fought, I had him—his strength, his determination, his absolute refusal to let anything happen to the people he cared about.

We weren't two separate fighters trying to protect each other at the expense of our safety. We were *one*, moving in perfect synchronization, our powers weaving together in patterns that felt as natural as breathing.

*There.* I sent the direction through our bond, having spotted Ambassador Kaine in the chaos. He was standing at the edge of the destruction, not even pretending to help, and the satisfied smirk on his face made my blood boil.

*I see him,* Riven responded, his rage matching mine. *But first—*

A scream cut through the air. One of the younger vampires—I thought her name was Celeste—had been cornered by two elementals. She was fast, but they were faster, and I watched in horror as stone fists descended toward her unprotected form.

Riven moved before I could even send a warning. Blood magic exploded from him in a wave that made the elementals stagger back, buying precious seconds. I shifted and ran, grabbing Celeste and hauling her toward the emergency exits with strength born of centuries and desperation.

"Go!" I shouted at her, already turning back. "Get out, get safe—"

The elemental's fist caught me across the ribs, and I felt something crack. Pain exploded through my torso, sharp and immediate, and through our bond I felt Riven's answering roar of fury.

*No no no no—*

"I'm *fine*," I gasped, both out loud and through our connection, even as I tasted blood. Shifted to panther because four legs were more stable than two right now, because the pain was less in this form, because I needed to keep moving or I'd fall and Riven would do something stupid trying to reach me.

But he was already there, his body between me and the elemental, his power blazing so bright it hurt to look at through our bond.

"*Don't. Touch. Her.*"

I'd heard Riven angry before. I'd felt his rage through our bond when we'd discussed his parents' deaths, when we'd trained, when he'd faced down enemies in the past months.

But this was different. This wasn't anger. This was *wrath*. Pure, incandescent, absolutely terrifying wrath.

Blood magic erupted from him in a torrent that made my earlier assessment of his power seem quaint. The elemental that had struck me simply... *dissolved*. Didn't explode or shatter—*dissolved*, its stone body returning to its component elements under the sheer force of Riven's fury.

*Riven.* I sent it through our bond with all the urgency I could muster. *I'm okay. I'm healing. But you need to control—*

*They hurt you.*

His voice through our bond was ice and fire combined, and I could feel him reaching for more power, could feel the dangerous edge he was approaching where control gave way to pure destruction.

I did the only thing I could do. I shifted back to human—ribs screaming in protest—and wrapped my arms around him from behind. Pressed my body against his, let him feel through our bond that I was alive, breathing, *here*.

"I'm okay," I whispered against his back. "I'm okay, my love. But I need you to breathe. I need you to center. You're going to hurt yourself if you keep channeling this much power."

For a terrifying moment, I thought he wouldn't listen. Thought the rage and fear would consume him. But then I felt him *trying*, felt him pulling back from that edge, felt his breathing slow as he grounded himself in our connection.

"I can't lose you," he said, his voice raw. "I can't—"

"You won't." I moved around to face him, cupping his face in my hands despite the pain in my ribs. "I'm a familiar, remember? I'm harder to kill than most. And I have you watching my back. We're going to be fine."

His eyes searched mine, and I knew he could feel the lie in that last statement through our bond. We might not be fine. People were dying around us. This attack was coordinated and brutal and we were still in incredible danger.

But I also needed him to believe we had a chance. Needed him to stay focused instead of consumed by fear for me.

"Together," he finally said, echoing our earlier promise.

"Together," I agreed.

The rest of the battle passed in a blur. More elementals. More screams. The sickening crunch of stone against flesh as three people—two vampires and a werewolf—fell despite our best efforts. Every death hit me like a physical blow, and through our bond, I knew Riven felt them even more keenly.

But we kept fighting. Kept moving. Kept protecting everyone we could reach.

By the time the elementals finally crumbled—their connection to Terravos apparently severed—we were both exhausted, bloody, and furious. I had at least two cracked ribs, multiple lacerations, and bruises that would have put a human in the hospital. Riven had overextended himself magically and was swaying on his feet despite his determination to stay upright.

We stood in the center of the destroyed Grand Hall, surrounded by debris and the wounded, and I felt him trembling against me as the adrenaline began to wear off.

"We saved most of them," I said softly, knowing he needed to hear it. "Without you, without your quick thinking and your power, the casualties would have been so much worse."

"But not all of them." His voice was hollow. "Three people are dead, Raechelle. Three people who came here to celebrate, to dance, to—" His voice cracked. "And that bastard Kaine is still *alive*, still *smirking*, still—"

"I know." I pulled him against me, ignoring the protest from my ribs. "I know, love. But you can't let the rage consume you. That's what Terravos wants. That's what this whole attack was designed to do—to make you lose control, to make you act rashly, to give them an excuse to—"

"I know what it was designed to do," he interrupted, but there was no heat in it. Just exhaustion. Just grief. "I just... I hate feeling this powerless. I hate that we can't—"

"We will," I promised him. "We'll make them pay for this. For your parents, for these deaths, for all of it. But we'll do it smart. We'll do it *right*. And we'll do it together."

Through our bond, I felt him draw strength from my certainty. Felt him straightening, squaring his shoulders, becoming once again the Archon Nocturne needed him to be instead of the grieving young man he was allowed to be in private.

"Together," he agreed one more time.

And as we turned to face the aftermath, to help the wounded and comfort the grieving and begin the process of rebuilding, I sent a silent prayer to whatever gods might be listening.

*Keep him safe. Keep him strong. Keep him* mine.

Because I'd learned something crucial tonight, standing in that ballroom while chaos reigned around us. Something I should have known from the moment our bond completed under that full moon months ago.

I couldn't protect Riven from everything. Couldn't shield him from pain or loss or the terrible weight of responsibility he carried. Couldn't keep him safe by wrapping him in cotton and hiding him from the world.

But I could stand beside him. Could lend him my strength when his wavered. Could remind him of who he was when the darkness threatened to consume him.

I could love him—fiercely, completely, without reservation—and trust that our bond, our partnership, our *love* would be enough to see us through whatever came next.

Even if it terrified me.

Especially because it terrified me.

Because the best things in life, as Riven had once told me, were probably terrifying.

Otherwise, they wouldn't be worth having.
