---

The birthday party was getting out of hand, and I loved every second of it.

Not the formal Council celebration scheduled for tomorrow—that would be all speeches and political posturing and carefully choreographed congratulations. No, this was my actual party, the one I'd planned with my friends, held in the newly expanded gardens of the Archon Spire. Two hundred guests, mostly supernatural beings under thirty, with music loud enough to make the older residents grumble and magic displays flashy enough to light up the night sky.

"Elena!" Tessa Nightshade materialized beside me, vampire speed making her entrances perpetually dramatic. "Your gift table is overflowing. I think Lady Seraphina sent you an actual throne. Like, a literal throne made of crystallized Blood Archon essence."

"She's very literal sometimes," I said, laughing. "I'll send a thank-you note tomorrow. How's the perimeter? Anyone trying to crash?"

"Marcus caught three reporters trying to sneak in with fake invitations. Sent them packing with a very polite 'fuck off.'" Tessa grinned. "I like him. For a werewolf-witch hybrid, he's surprisingly pleasant."

Marcus Ironheart was academy security, technically working for my father but somehow always ending up assigned to events I attended. I hadn't decided yet if that was deliberate matchmaking or just convenient coincidence. Either way, I didn't mind. He was competent, professional, and distractingly attractive when he wasn't trying to be.

"Has Dad made his appearance yet?" I asked, scanning the crowd. "He promised he'd show up for at least an hour before retreating to let the kids have fun."

"He's over by the food tables with your mom, looking vaguely uncomfortable while pretending to enjoy trap music." Tessa pointed, and sure enough, there was Riven Sixxx—the Balance, the Prime Archon, hero of the Devourer crisis—awkwardly nodding along to a beat he clearly didn't understand while Raechelle tried not to laugh at him.

I felt a surge of affection watching them. Three years since the Devourer was sealed, and they'd finally settled into something resembling normal life. Dad still coordinated Balance duties, but he'd learned to delegate, to trust others, to be more facilitator than dictator. Mom had transitioned from active field work to training the next generation, and their relationship had evolved into something even stronger than before—partnership without codependency.

"Elena!" Another voice, this one familiar and complicated. Lucian Darkfire pushed through the crowd, dark hair messy and eyes bright with excitement. "You have to see what Sera learned to do with flame constructs. It's insane. She can make them persist for like five minutes without active concentration."

Lucian. My oldest friend, brilliant and passionate and increasingly frustrated with the pace of reform in supernatural society. We'd grown up together, trained together, survived the chaos of the Devourer crisis together. But lately, conversations with him had become... complicated. Political. Angry.

"That's impressive," I said carefully. "Traditional training says flame constructs should collapse after thirty seconds max."

"Right? That's what I'm saying—the traditional methods don't account for how our generation's magic works differently. We need new training approaches, new techniques, new ways of thinking about power." His enthusiasm was infectious, but there was an edge to it. "This is exactly why the academy curriculum needs reform. We can't keep teaching like it's still the 1800s."

"The academy is only three years old," I pointed out. "It is new approaches."

"It's new locations teaching old methods," Lucian countered. "We need actually new thinking, Elena. Revolutionary thinking, not just evolutionary."

Before I could respond, the music cut out abruptly. A ripple of confusion spread through the crowd, then someone screamed.

I was moving before consciously deciding to, blood magic flaring instinctively as I pushed through bodies toward the source of the disturbance. The crowd parted, revealing a young Blood Archon—maybe sixteen, a recent academy graduate named Devon—collapsed on the ground, convulsing. His magic was going haywire, blood constructs forming and dissolving chaotically around him, each one more violent than the last.

"Everyone back!" I commanded, authority ringing in my voice—the same tone Dad used during crises. The crowd obeyed instantly, creating a circle of space around the thrashing boy.

I dropped to my knees beside Devon, reaching out with my power to assess what was happening. His magic felt wrong—like it was fighting itself, surging and collapsing in erratic patterns completely divorced from his conscious control. This wasn't just panic or inexperience. Something was fundamentally off.

"Devon, can you hear me?" I kept my voice calm despite the urgency. "I need you to try to slow your breathing. In for four counts, hold for four, out for four."

"Can't—" he gasped, eyes wide with terror. "Can't control it. It's not listening. It's not—"

Another surge, more violent than the rest. Blood constructs exploded outward in jagged spikes, and I barely got a shield up in time to protect the nearest bystanders. This was bad. Really bad. If I couldn't get his magic under control, he could hurt someone—or himself.

"Elena." Mom's voice, calm and steady, from somewhere behind me. "I'm here. What do you need?"

"Help me contain him," I said, not looking away from Devon. "His magic is cycling too fast for normal suppression. We need to interrupt the pattern."

"On it." Mom's presence settled beside me, her ancient power joining mine. Together, we wove a containment field around Devon, not trying to suppress his magic entirely—that could cause catastrophic backlash—but damping the oscillations, slowing the chaotic cycling.

It took three minutes of intense concentration, but gradually Devon's thrashing subsided. His magic settled into something closer to normal, though it still felt unstable underneath, like a storm temporarily quieted.

"Get him to the infirmary," Mom said quietly. "I'll contact Zephyra and your father. This is the third incident like this in two weeks."

Third? I looked up sharply. "Third?"

"We've been trying to keep it quiet, avoid causing panic." Mom's expression was grim. "But if it's happening at your birthday party, to a trained academy graduate, we can't hide it anymore. Something is wrong."

---

The emergency Council meeting was called for dawn, which gave me about four hours of sleep after spending the rest of the night ensuring Devon was stable. He'd eventually been sedated, his magic forcibly suppressed by Zephyra's overwhelming power, but the wild cycling had left him exhausted and disoriented.

I arrived at the Council chamber to find it already packed. Not just Council members, but heads of all major factions, senior instructors from the academy, and both my parents looking exhausted. Dad spotted me immediately and nodded toward an empty seat near the front—acknowledgment that I wasn't just here as "Riven's daughter" but as someone directly involved in the situation.

"Thank you all for coming on short notice," Dad began once everyone had settled. "We have a situation that requires immediate attention. Over the past three weeks, we've had five confirmed incidents of what we're calling 'wild manifestations'—spontaneous, uncontrolled surges of magic that the affected individual cannot suppress or direct. All victims have been young supernatural beings, ages fifteen to twenty-two. All were previously trained and had demonstrated normal magical control before the incidents."

He gestured, and a magical display materialized showing data on each case. Dates, locations, power signatures, outcomes.

"Last night's incident at Elena's celebration was the most public so far," he continued. "We can no longer contain information about this phenomenon. We need to understand what's causing it and how to prevent further occurrences before someone gets killed."

"Do we have any pattern analysis?" Zephyra asked from her seat. The ancient Prime Archon looked troubled, which was never a good sign. "Common factors among the victims?"

"Age range is the most obvious pattern," Mom said, standing to present findings. "All victims are under twenty-five. Beyond that, they come from different factions, different training backgrounds, different power levels. The only other commonality is that the manifestations seem to be triggered by emotional stress—high excitement, anger, or fear."

"So young supernatural beings lose control when emotional," Councilor Theron Ashfall said dismissively. "That's not new. It's called adolescence."

"This is different," I said, standing without thinking about it. All eyes turned to me, and I felt the weight of that attention—elder Council members, faction heads, my father. But I'd been there last night. I'd felt what was happening with Devon's magic. I knew this wasn't normal. "Traditional loss of control is about inadequate training or discipline. What happened to Devon last night was his magic actively fighting his attempts at control. Like it was operating on different rules than he'd been taught."

"Explain," Dad said, his tone encouraging rather than challenging.

I took a breath, organizing my thoughts. "When someone loses control normally, you can help them regain it by walking them through the traditional techniques—breathing exercises, mental focus patterns, hierarchical power structuring. I tried all of that with Devon. None of it worked. His magic wasn't responding to traditional methods at all. It was like... like trying to speak a language that sounds similar but follows completely different grammar rules."

Silence filled the chamber as people processed that. Then Lucian stood from where he'd been seated in the observers' section.

"May I speak?" he asked, looking at Dad. When permission was granted, he continued: "Elena's right. I've been researching this for months—independently, because I thought I was seeing anomalies that would be dismissed as inexperience. But younger supernatural beings' magic operates differently than how we're being taught. We have more raw power but less instinctive control. We can do things traditional methods say should be impossible, but we struggle with things that should be basic. The training methods being used were developed centuries ago for different magical expression patterns."

"Are you suggesting our entire educational system is flawed?" Lady Seraphina asked, ice in her voice.

"I'm suggesting it's outdated," Lucian said firmly. "Not wrong for its time, but insufficient for current needs. Magic evolves. Supernatural abilities evolve. The younger generation is experiencing that evolution firsthand, and we're being trained using methods designed for the previous generation's capabilities."

Murmurs rippled through the chamber, some agreeing, others dismissive. I watched Dad's face, seeing him process the implications. He'd always been adaptable, willing to change tactics when evidence demanded it. But this was challenging foundational assumptions about how magic worked.

"So your theory," Zephyra said slowly, "is that wild manifestations are not magical failures but magical evolution? New capabilities trying to express through old frameworks?"

"Exactly," Lucian said, relief evident that someone understood. "The manifestations are dangerous because we're trying to force evolved magic into obsolete control structures. It's like trying to run modern software on ancient hardware—eventually something breaks catastrophically."

"That's a significant claim," Dad said. "Do you have evidence beyond correlation?"

"I have data on power expression patterns from forty-seven young supernatural beings," Lucian replied. "I've been documenting the differences between how magic manifests in those under twenty-five versus those over thirty. The patterns are distinctly different. I can present findings if the Council is willing to review them."

I saw Dad exchange glances with Mom and Zephyra, silent communication passing between them. Then Dad nodded.

"Present your findings this afternoon. We'll convene a working group to analyze the data and develop potential solutions." He looked around the chamber. "Until we understand this better, I'm recommending that all young supernatural beings avoid high-stress situations when possible, and that training instructors implement immediate observation protocols to catch manifestations early. Are there any objections?"

There were a few grumbles about coddling the youth, but no formal objections. The Council was taking this seriously, which was both reassuring and terrifying. If even Dad and Zephyra were concerned, this was bigger than anyone had initially realized.

As the meeting broke up, I found myself standing with Lucian near the chamber's exit.

"Thank you for backing me up in there," he said quietly. "I wasn't sure anyone would take the theory seriously."

"You were right about what I felt last night," I replied. "Devon's magic wasn't malfunctioning—it was functioning differently than we expected. The question is what we do about it."

"That's where it gets complicated." Lucian's expression darkened. "Because the solution probably requires admitting that the traditional power structures and training methods need complete overhaul. And there are a lot of people invested in those systems staying exactly as they are."

"Reform takes time," I said. "We need to build consensus, demonstrate that changes work before implementing them broadly. That's how Dad unified the supernatural community after the Devourer crisis—incremental change with proof of concept."

"And how many more kids have wild manifestations while we're taking our time building consensus?" Lucian challenged. "How many get hurt or killed because we're prioritizing political comfort over necessary change?"

I didn't have a good answer to that. He was right that moving slowly had costs. But I'd also watched what happened when change was forced too quickly—resistance, backlash, chaos. There had to be a balance between necessary urgency and sustainable implementation.

"We need to find a middle path," I said finally. "Fast enough to prevent casualties, slow enough to bring people along. I know that's frustrating, but—"

"But that's politics," Lucian finished, frustration clear. "I know. I just wish we could afford to prioritize lives over political sensibilities."

He walked away before I could respond, leaving me standing alone with the uncomfortable certainty that this conversation was going to define our friendship for the foreseeable future. Lucian wanted revolution. I believed in reform. And neither of us was entirely wrong.

That afternoon's data presentation was... illuminating.

Lucian had been thorough. His research showed clear divergence in magical expression patterns between age cohorts, with the split point around age twenty-five being remarkably consistent across all supernatural species. Younger beings demonstrated higher raw power output but less instinctive control. They could sustain complex working longer but had more difficulty with precision. They showed entirely new capabilities—like Sera's persistent flame constructs—that traditional training said should be impossible.

"The pattern suggests generational capability shift," Zephyra said, studying the data with academic fascination. "Similar to documented evolutionary jumps in supernatural abilities throughout history. If this is genuine evolution rather than anomaly, the implications are significant."

"How significant?" Lady Seraphina asked.

"Significant enough that trying to suppress it would be both futile and dangerous," Zephyra replied. "Evolutionary changes in magic happen when collective conditions demand adaptation. Trying to force evolved capabilities into previous-generation frameworks creates exactly the kind of instability we're seeing with wild manifestations."

"So what do we do?" Mom asked. "We can't just tell an entire generation 'figure it out yourselves' and hope they don't accidentally destroy something important."

"We need new training methods," I said, the idea crystallizing as I spoke. "Methods designed for how magic works now, not how it worked fifty years ago. Lucian's research shows the patterns—we use that to develop updated techniques, test them with volunteer subjects, refine based on results."

"That will take months," Councilor Ashfall objected. "Maybe years."

"Then we'd better start immediately," Dad said firmly. "Elena, you're eighteen today—newly adult by supernatural standards. You've also demonstrated remarkable control despite apparently having this evolved magic yourself. I'm appointing you to lead the research project, with Zephyra as senior advisor and Lucian as primary researcher."

I felt something tight in my chest—pride, terror, responsibility, all mixed together. This was the first time Dad had publicly assigned me independent authority on a Council project. It was acknowledgment that I was adult enough, capable enough, to be trusted with something this important.

It was also potentially setting me up to fail spectacularly if we couldn't solve the wild manifestation problem.

"I accept," I said, keeping my voice steady. "When do we start?"

"Now," Zephyra said, standing with purpose. "I've cleared my schedule. We have a crisis to solve, and unlike the Devourer, this one requires innovation rather than just overwhelming force. Much more interesting."

The meeting broke up with action items assigned and timelines established. I found myself immediately surrounded by people wanting details, offering help, or—in a few cases—expressing skepticism that someone my age should be leading such critical work.

Through it all, I caught Dad watching me with an expression I recognized—pride mixed with concern, confidence mixed with protective instinct. He was giving me the chance to establish myself independent of his shadow, but he wasn't going to stop worrying. I understood. If our positions were reversed, I'd feel the same way.

"Elena." Marcus Ironheart appeared at my elbow, somehow having navigated through the crowd without anyone noticing. "Congratulations on the appointment. Also, you should probably eat something before the afternoon research session. You've been running on adrenaline and birthday cake for sixteen hours."

"I'm fine," I said automatically, then realized I was actually starving. "Okay, maybe I should eat something."

"Thought so." He produced a wrapped sandwich from somewhere—some kind of security magic that let him carry supplies without visible pockets. "Turkey and avocado, your usual. And before you ask, yes, I pay attention to what you order at the academy cafeteria. It's literally my job to know the patterns of people I'm assigned to protect."

"I haven't been assigned personal protection," I pointed out, taking the sandwich gratefully.

"No, but as the Balance's daughter working on a high-priority Council project, you're getting it anyway. Nonnegotiable." Marcus's expression was professional, but there was warmth underneath. "Besides, someone needs to make sure you actually take care of yourself when you're in full research mode. I've watched you pull thirty-hour working stretches without remembering to eat."

"That was one time. And there was a deadline."

"It was three times, and deadlines don't excuse neglecting basic needs." He steered me toward a quiet corner of the Council building's atrium. "Eat. Breathe. Process what just happened. Then you can go save the world. In that order."

I wanted to argue, but he was right. The sandwich was delicious, and sitting down for five minutes helped the chaos in my head settle into something more organized. Marcus stood nearby, not hovering but available, professional but not cold.

"Thank you," I said after finishing the sandwich. "For this. For earlier at the party. For being generally competent at your job."

"That's what they pay me for," Marcus replied with a slight smile. "Though I'll admit, 'standing around while supernatural teenagers have magical breakdowns' wasn't explicitly in the job description. I'm learning to improvise."

"You're good at it."

"I've had good teachers. Your mother's training program is remarkably thorough." He paused, then added more quietly: "You did well today. Both at the party handling the crisis and at the Council meeting presenting your analysis. That's genuine leadership, not just riding on your father's reputation."

The compliment hit different coming from Marcus—maybe because he had no political reason to flatter me, no agenda beyond doing his job well. It felt honest.

"I'm terrified I'm going to screw this up," I admitted. "That I'll fail to solve the manifestation problem and people will get hurt because I wasn't good enough."

"That's how you know you're taking it seriously," Marcus said. "The people who scare me are the ones who aren't afraid of failing. Your fear means you understand the stakes." He met my eyes directly. "But for what it's worth? I think you can do this. You're brilliant, creative, and you genuinely care about protecting people. That's a pretty solid foundation for success."

Before I could respond, Zephyra's voice echoed through the atrium: "Elena! Stop flirting with security personnel and come look at this data. I've found something interesting."

I felt my face heat. "I wasn't flirting!"

"Sure," Marcus said, clearly amused. "Go. Brilliant ancient Prime Archon needs your brilliant young mind. I'll be around if you need more sandwiches or life advice."

I fled toward Zephyra's voice, very deliberately not thinking about whether I had been flirting and what it meant that the idea didn't displease me as much as it probably should have.

Research. I had research to do. Wild manifestations to understand. A generation to potentially save.

Romance could wait. Probably. Maybe.

Focus, Elena.

The next three days were a blur of research, testing, and incremental breakthroughs.

Zephyra had found historical records of similar evolutionary shifts in supernatural abilities, dated approximately four hundred years apart. Each shift had been accompanied by a period of instability as the community adapted to new capabilities, followed by rapid advancement once appropriate training methods were developed.

"We're living through a predictable pattern," she explained, ancient texts spread across the research room table. "Every few centuries, environmental pressures or collective consciousness shifts trigger evolutionary leap in magical expression. Young supernatural beings adapt first because they're still developing, while older beings retain previous-generation patterns. The instability comes from trying to teach evolved abilities using pre-evolution frameworks."

"So this isn't just our generation," I said, studying the records. "It's happened before."

"Multiple times throughout supernatural history," Zephyra confirmed. "But institutional memory is poor—each generation tends to view their experiences as unique rather than recognizing cyclical patterns. The last major shift was in the 1620s. Very few beings from that era are still active, and most of them didn't keep detailed records about adaptation processes."

"Meaning we're effectively starting from scratch developing new training methods," Lucian said, frustrated. "Despite this being completely predictable if anyone had bothered to maintain historical knowledge."

"Institutional failures aside," I interrupted before Lucian could spiral into full rant mode, "this gives us a framework. We know evolutionary shifts are natural and survivable. We know adaptation is possible. We just need to figure out the specific techniques that work for current-generation capabilities."

Over those three days, we tested dozens of approaches with volunteer subjects—young supernatural beings who'd experienced minor manifestation symptoms but hadn't had full breakdowns yet. Traditional hierarchical control structures failed consistently. But approaches emphasizing fluid adaptation, emotional integration rather than suppression, and collaborative power management showed promising results.

"It's like the difference between classical physics and quantum mechanics," I explained during a late-night research session. "Classical approaches assume predictable, mechanistic behavior. But evolved magic operates more probabilistically—less about forcing power into specific channels and more about creating conditions for desired outcomes to manifest naturally."

"That metaphor works surprisingly well," Zephyra said, making notes. "Traditional training teaches power as tool to be wielded with precision. But evolved capabilities resist that kind of external control. They respond better to internal alignment—making conscious desire and magical expression congruent rather than fighting to force compliance."

"Which means we're teaching fundamentally different relationship with power," Lucian added. "Not mastery through dominance, but mastery through harmony. That's going to be controversial with anyone who views control as absolute rather than relative."

He wasn't wrong. When we presented preliminary findings to the Council, resistance was immediate from traditionalist quarters.

"You're suggesting we abandon proven methods that have worked for centuries," Councilor Ashfall said, dismissive. "Based on three days of research with a sample size of what, fifteen subjects?"

"I'm suggesting we adapt proven methods to current conditions," I corrected. "And yes, the sample size is small because we're being careful. But the fifteen subjects who've learned these techniques haven't had any further manifestation incidents, while in the same time period we've had three new cases among the general population using traditional training."

"Correlation doesn't prove causation."

"No, but it suggests direction worth investigating," Dad interjected. "Elena's team has done exactly what I asked—identified patterns, developed potential solutions, tested carefully. The next phase is broader implementation with continued monitoring."

"Respectfully, Balance, I think broader implementation is premature," Lady Seraphina said. "We need more extensive testing, longer observation periods, peer review of the methodology—"

"While we're doing extensive testing, how many more kids have wild manifestations?" Lucian challenged. "How many get hurt because we prioritized bureaucratic procedures over actual solutions?"

"Bureaucratic procedures exist to prevent hasty decisions that make problems worse," Lady Seraphina shot back. "Your passion is admirable, but—"

"My passion?" Lucian's voice went dangerously quiet. "Lady Seraphina, with respect, you weren't the one holding Devon while he nearly killed himself because his magic stopped responding to the 'proven methods' you're so invested in protecting. You didn't watch someone younger than you thrash on the ground, terrified, because everything he'd been taught about controlling his power had suddenly stopped working. So yes, I'm passionate about finding solutions quickly, because lives are at stake."

Silence fell across the Council chamber, tense and charged. Dad looked like he was about to intervene, but Zephyra spoke first.

"The young one has a point," she said calmly. "Though perhaps expressed more diplomatically. We're at an inflection point—move too slowly and people suffer, move too quickly and we risk broader instability. The appropriate path is aggressive cautious implementation: expand the program to larger test group, maintain careful monitoring, be prepared to adjust based on results."

"I can support that approach," Dad said. "Elena, how many subjects can your team handle responsibly?"

I did quick mental math. "With current resources, maybe fifty additional subjects. If we get more instructors trained in the new methods, we could scale to two hundred within a month."

"Then let's do that. Fifty immediate expansion, recruitment and training of additional instructors to enable broader scaling." Dad looked around the chamber. "Any formal objections?"

There were grumbles, but no formal objections. The motion passed, and we had approval to continue.

As the meeting broke up, I caught Lucian near the exit. "You need to be more careful how you challenge Council elders," I said quietly. "Lady Seraphina isn't our enemy, and alienating her doesn't help our cause."

"She's blocking progress to protect her own political position," Lucian countered. "That makes her part of the problem, even if not actively malicious."

"She's blocking what she perceives as unsafe rapid change based on insufficient evidence," I corrected. "That's actually the Council's job—providing oversight and requiring due diligence. We're not fighting against the system, Lucian. We're working within it to change it."

"And if working within it moves too slowly to prevent casualties?"

"Then we document every casualty and use that evidence to push for faster change," I said firmly. "But we don't abandon the system entirely, because that leads to chaos. I've watched Dad navigate these politics for years. Sustainable change requires bringing people along, not forcing them to comply."

Lucian looked at me for a long moment, something complicated in his expression. "You sound like him. Your father. Same philosophy, same approach, same belief that working within the system is always the right answer."

"Because it is," I said. "Revolution sounds romantic, but it usually just replaces one broken system with another. Reform is slower but produces better long-term results."

"I hope you're right," Lucian said quietly. "Because if you're wrong, a lot of people are going to pay the price for your careful, measured, politically sensitive approach."

He walked away, and I stood there feeling like I'd just lost an argument despite technically winning. Because he was right that every day we spent building consensus was a day someone else might have a wild manifestation. But I was also right that forcing change too quickly would create backlash that undermined everything we'd accomplished.

There had to be a better path forward. I just hadn't figured it out yet.

---

That evening, I found myself on the Archon Spire's observation deck, staring out over Nocturne's nighttime landscape. The city looked peaceful from up here—lights twinkling, people going about their lives, no visible signs of the crisis we were trying to manage.

"You look contemplative," Mom's voice said from behind me. "That's usually your father's thing. Should I be worried you're taking after him too completely?"

I smiled despite myself. "Just processing. Today was... a lot."

"Most days involving magical crises and Council politics are." Mom joined me at the railing, her presence comforting. "You did well, though. Both with the research and with navigating the political aspects. Your father is proud, even if he's trying not to be too obvious about it."

"Is he worried I'll screw this up?"

"He's worried you'll put too much pressure on yourself and forget to take care of your own needs," Mom corrected. "Classic parental concern. I've assured him you inherited my practical sense along with his magical power, so you're probably fine."

"Probably?"

"Well, you are only eighteen," Mom pointed out with amusement. "Some amount of poor judgment is statistically inevitable. We're just hoping you make interesting mistakes rather than catastrophic ones."

I laughed, tension easing slightly. "That's reassuring."

"It's realistic." Mom's expression turned more serious. "Elena, I know this situation is complicated. The wild manifestations, the generational divide, Lucian's increasing radicalization, Council politics, your own development as a Prime Archon—that's a lot to navigate simultaneously. Don't feel like you have to have all the answers right now."

"But people are counting on me to have answers," I said. "Dad put me in charge of this project. If I fail—"

"If you fail, we'll figure out alternative approaches together," Mom interrupted firmly. "You're not alone in this. Yes, your father gave you leadership authority, but that doesn't mean you're operating without support. Zephyra, Lucian, me, your father, the entire research team—we're all working on this together. You're not carrying this burden solo."

Logically, I knew that. Emotionally, it still felt like the weight of it rested on my shoulders. Because this was my first real test of independent leadership, my first chance to prove I was more than just "Riven Sixxx's daughter," and failing would confirm every skeptic who thought I was too young, too inexperienced, too reliant on family reputation.

"I don't want to let anyone down," I admitted quietly.

"Then don't," Mom said simply. "Work hard, stay focused, ask for help when you need it, and trust your instincts. That's all anyone can do. The outcome isn't entirely in your control—there are too many variables, too many unknowns. But your effort, your integrity, your commitment to doing this right? That's completely within your control. Focus on what you can influence, not what you can't."

Simple advice. Practical advice. Exactly the kind of wisdom I needed.

"Thank you," I said, meaning it.

"Anytime." Mom squeezed my shoulder. "Now come inside. Your father is pretending he's not anxiously waiting to hear how you're processing everything, and I promised I'd bring you back for family dinner before he gives himself an ulcer from excessive parental concern."

We headed inside together, and I felt some of the weight lift. Mom was right—I wasn't alone in this. Whatever challenges came next, I had resources, support, and people who believed in me.

I could do this.

I would do this.

Even if I hadn't figured out exactly how yet.
