## Book 5 Details

**Timeline**: Three years after Book 4  
**Protagonist**: Elena Sixxx-Darkpurr (Age 18-21)  
**Word Count Target**: ~70,000-80,000 words  
**Average Chapter Length**: ~6,000-7,000 words

**Core Conflict**: Generational divide in supernatural community, wild magical manifestations, Elena finding her own leadership path.

## Writing Guidelines

When chapters are written, they should:
1. Use Elena's POV for main narrative (distinct from Riven's voice)
2. Follow the detailed outlines in `../Book5.md`
3. Maintain consistency with Books 1-4 continuity
4. Explore themes of generational change and identity
5. Balance political intrigue with personal growth
6. Show Elena's unique leadership style (collaborative, less authoritative)
7. Develop relationships (Lucian friendship/rivalry, Marcus romance)
8. Track magical evolution phenomenon consistently

## Chapter Format

Each chapter file should include:
- Chapter number and title as header
- Word count estimate
- POV character
- Timeline marker
- Main narrative content
- Writer's notes section (key events, continuity notes, etc.)

See `CHAPTER_TEMPLATE.md` (to be created) for full formatting details.

## Integration

Once all chapters are written:
1. Chapters will be integrated into `Blood-Craft-Canonical.md`
2. Book5.md will be updated with completion status
3. Chapter-Summary-and-Timeline.md will be extended
4. book-structure.json will be updated
5. Blood-Craft-Reader.html will be regenerated
