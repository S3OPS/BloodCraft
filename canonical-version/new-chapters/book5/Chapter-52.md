The research facility we'd set up in the academy's east wing had become my second home. Whiteboards covered every wall, filled with magical signature analyses, training protocol notes, and increasingly elaborate theories about evolutionary magic patterns. Zephyra had somehow acquired a vintage coffee machine—ancient even by her standards—that produced the strongest brew I'd ever tasted. I was currently on my fourth cup of the day, and it was only noon.

"You're going to vibrate through dimensions if you keep drinking that," Marcus observed from his post by the door. He'd been assigned as permanent security for the research project, which meant I saw him approximately sixteen hours a day. I was trying very hard not to think about how that didn't bother me as much as it should.

"Science requires caffeine," I said, not looking up from the data spread across my desk. "Historical precedent supports this."

"Historical precedent also suggests sleeping occasionally." He moved closer, studying the charts with genuine interest rather than just professional observation. "What am I looking at?"

"Power manifestation timelines for forty-three subjects," I explained, gesturing at the color-coded graphs. "See how the traditional control metrics—precision, duration, power output—don't correlate with manifestation risk? Traditional teaching assumes higher power equals higher risk, but that's not what we're seeing."

"What does correlate?"

"Emotional suppression." I pulled up a different chart. "Subjects who've been taught to strictly separate emotion from magical use show three times higher manifestation risk than those who integrate emotion into their practice. It's like... traditional methods teach you to wall off your feelings to maintain control, but evolved magic requires emotional authenticity to function properly."

"So the harder you try not to feel things, the more likely your magic goes haywire?" Marcus frowned thoughtfully. "That seems counterintuitive given everything supernatural society teaches about discipline and control."

"Which is exactly why we're having problems," I said. "Centuries of training methods built on emotional suppression meeting a generation whose magic literally requires emotional integration. The conflict creates instability."

Marcus was quiet for a moment, then: "That has implications beyond just magical training, doesn't it? About how the entire supernatural community approaches power and leadership."

I looked up, surprised. "What do you mean?"

"Think about it. Traditional power structures emphasize hierarchy, discipline, suppression of personal desires for collective good. That worked for the previous generation's capabilities. But if your generation's magic operates differently, requires different relationship with emotion and power..." He trailed off meaningfully.

"Then our political and social structures might be fundamentally mismatched to our capabilities," I finished, seeing where he was going. "That's... actually a really insightful observation."

"I'm not just a pretty face," Marcus said with a slight smile. "Though I appreciate you noticing that first."

I felt heat rise in my cheeks and deliberately turned back to my data. Definitely not thinking about whether Marcus was pretty. Or about how his hybrid nature—werewolf and witch, belonging fully to neither world—gave him unique perspective on integration rather than separation.

"Elena." Zephyra's voice preceded her through the door by about three seconds, giving me just enough warning to attempt looking professionally focused rather than blushing. "We have a problem. Three more manifestation cases in the past hour, all in the same location."

"Three in one hour?" I stood immediately. "Where?"

"The Confluence District," Zephyra said grimly. "Which is interesting because that's where Lucian's reform movement has been holding their public rallies. I don't think that's coincidence."

No, it definitely wasn't. The Confluence District was Nocturne's most politically active area, where younger supernatural beings gathered to debate policy, protest Council decisions, and generally agitate for faster change. If wild manifestations were happening there with increased frequency...

"The emotional stress trigger," I said, pieces clicking together. "High political tension, passionate speeches, large crowds of young people all worked up about the pace of reform. That's creating the perfect conditions for manifestations."

"Worse than that," Zephyra said. "I spoke with the response team. All three manifestations occurred during Lucian's speech about dismantling traditional power structures. His rhetoric is literally destabilizing his audience."

"He doesn't know," I said immediately, defensive instinct kicking in. "Lucian wouldn't deliberately cause manifestations."

"Intent doesn't matter if the result is people getting hurt," Zephyra replied, not unkindly. "He needs to be informed about the connection and asked to moderate his messaging until we have better containment protocols."

"That's going to go over well," I muttered. Lucian already believed the Council was trying to suppress his movement. Being told to tone down his rhetoric for safety reasons would read as political censorship, not genuine concern.

"Would you like me to speak with him?" Zephyra offered. "Sometimes hearing difficult truths from someone without personal connection is easier."

"No, I'll do it." I grabbed my jacket. "He's my friend. If this has to be a difficult conversation, it should at least be with someone he trusts. Marcus, are you—"

"Already coming," Marcus said, falling into step beside me. "Also already put the research facility on security alert and notified your father about the situation."

"Efficient."

"It's literally my job."

The Confluence District was everything I'd expected and nothing I was prepared for.

Hundreds of young supernatural beings packed the plaza, energy crackling in the air—not just magical, but emotional, ideological, passionate. Hand-painted signs proclaimed slogans ranging from reasonable ("Reform Training Methods Now") to radical ("Dismantle Council Authority") to concerning ("Power to the Young"). Someone had set up amplification crystals so Lucian's voice carried across the entire gathering.

"—telling us to wait, to be patient, to trust the process," Lucian was saying, his natural charisma amplified by righteous anger. "But how many more of us have to suffer wild manifestations because the Council won't admit their precious traditional methods are failing? How many of our friends have to nearly die before the old guard acknowledges that their way doesn't work anymore?"

The crowd roared approval, and I felt the surge of emotion like a physical wave. Anger, frustration, hope, fear—all amplified by collective energy. And underneath it, I could sense the magical instability, power responding to emotional intensity without conscious control.

"This is a disaster waiting to happen," Marcus said quietly beside me. "The emotional charge here is off the charts. One wrong word and this whole plaza could erupt into manifestations."

He was right. I could feel it—hundreds of young supernatural beings, all emotionally activated, all with evolved magic that responded to emotional state. This wasn't a rally. This was a powder keg.

I pushed through the crowd toward the makeshift stage where Lucian stood. People recognized me—Riven Sixxx's daughter, leader of the manifestation research project—and reactions were mixed. Some smiled, seeing an ally. Others frowned, viewing me as part of the establishment they were protesting.

"Lucian!" I called when I got close enough. "We need to talk!"

He spotted me and his expression flickered—surprise, pleasure, then wariness. "Elena. Come to shut down the rally?"

"Come to warn you that you're about to cause exactly the manifestations you're protesting," I shot back. "Three cases in the past hour, all at this location, all during your speech. Your rhetoric is creating the emotional conditions that trigger wild manifestations."

Lucian's face went through several expressions—disbelief, understanding, then defensive anger. "So what, I'm supposed to stop telling the truth because it makes people emotional? That's convenient for the Council."

"I'm asking you to be responsible about how you communicate that truth," I said, aware of people watching us. "You know manifestations are triggered by extreme emotional stress. You're deliberately working this crowd into a frenzy. People are going to get hurt, Lucian."

"People are already getting hurt by Council inaction," he countered. "My speech didn't cause the manifestation problem, Elena. The Council's refusal to implement systemic change did. I'm just not pretending everything is fine when it obviously isn't."

"I never said everything was fine! But there's a difference between advocating for change and creating conditions that cause the exact crisis you claim to be fighting against!"

Before Lucian could respond, I felt it—a surge of wild power from somewhere in the crowd. Someone's magic was cycling up, emotional activation triggering exactly the kind of manifestation I'd warned about.

"Manifestation!" I shouted, already moving. "Southeast quadrant, everyone clear back!"

The crowd parted in confusion and panic. I found the source quickly—a young Fire Archon, maybe seventeen, flames erupting uncontrollably around her as she tried desperately to contain them. Her terror was making it worse, feeding back into the manifestation in a vicious cycle.

I dropped to my knees beside her, power flaring as I wove containment structures. Not the traditional hierarchical suppression—that would just trigger more resistance. Instead, I used the emotional integration techniques we'd been developing, creating space for her power to express safely while gradually helping her regain conscious control.

"It's okay," I said calmly, maintaining the containment while projecting steadiness. "I've got you. Your magic isn't attacking you—it's responding to fear. We're going to work with it, not against it. Can you tell me your name?"

"S-Sera," she gasped. "Sera Fireflight. I'm sorry, I don't know what—"

"You don't need to apologize. This isn't your fault." I adjusted the containment as her flames began settling. "Your magic is evolved, and you've been taught control methods that don't match how your power actually works. That disconnect creates instability. But we can fix it. I need you to stop trying to suppress the flames and instead try to understand what they're responding to. What were you feeling right before the manifestation started?"

"Angry," Sera admitted. "Lucian was talking about how the Council doesn't care about us, and I just felt so... angry. And scared. And the magic just—"

"Responded to your emotions because that's how evolved magic works," I finished. "It's not wrong, it's just different. Let's try something. Keep breathing steadily. Don't try to control the flames directly. Instead, acknowledge what you're feeling—'I'm angry, I'm scared'—and then consciously choose to let that intensity ease. Not suppress it, just... release it. Let it flow through and out."

Sera tried, and gradually—so gradually—her flames began to settle. Not because she was forcing them down, but because the emotional fuel was naturally subsiding. Within five minutes, the manifestation had completely resolved. Sera looked exhausted but relieved, and remarkably, she hadn't hurt herself or anyone else.

"How did you do that?" she asked weakly. "Every time I've had these before, it took three instructors and full suppression to stop it."

"Because they were treating it like traditional loss of control," I explained, helping her stand. "But your magic doesn't respond to external force. It responds to internal alignment. Once you learn that distinction, you can prevent manifestations before they start."

Marcus appeared with medical personnel, who immediately began checking Sera over. The crowd had pulled back during the crisis but now they were pressing in again, murmuring about what they'd witnessed. I became uncomfortably aware that hundreds of people had just watched me successfully handle a manifestation using techniques that directly contradicted traditional training methods.

"That was incredible," a voice said from nearby. "She didn't suppress the girl's magic—she taught her to work with it."

"Did you see how fast she contained it? And without any backup?"

"Is that really Riven Sixxx's daughter? She's younger than half the people here."

Lucian materialized beside me, his expression complicated. "That was... Elena, that was masterful. The techniques you used—"

"Are exactly what I've been trying to tell the Council works," I said quietly, suddenly exhausted. "This is the fourth manifestation I've personally resolved using these methods. Every single one has ended faster and with less harm than traditional suppression would cause. But getting the Council to approve broader implementation takes time, evidence, consensus building. I'm doing everything I can to speed that up while maintaining the political support we need for lasting change."

"I know," Lucian said, and he sounded genuinely conflicted. "I know you're trying, Elena. But watching Sera nearly lose control because she was taught wrong, knowing there are hundreds more like her struggling with the same thing... how am I supposed to be patient when every day of delay means more suffering?"

"By acknowledging that rushing change without proper foundation causes different suffering," I replied. "Lucian, I'm not asking you to stop advocating. I'm asking you to do it responsibly. This rally—this level of emotional intensity—it creates conditions for manifestations. You saw what just happened. That could have ended badly if I hadn't been here."

"So what do you want me to do? Stop organizing? Stop speaking out? Just quietly work within the system while people continue getting hurt?"

"I want you to work with me instead of against me," I said, frustrated. "We're on the same side, Lucian. We both want younger supernatural beings to get training that actually works for how our magic operates. But I need you to understand that changing centuries of institutional practice takes time, and that your speeches creating conditions for manifestations undermines our case for systemic change."

"Because the Council will blame me for causing instability rather than acknowledging their own failures," Lucian said bitterly. "That's politically convenient."

"Because they're genuinely not wrong that this rally was dangerous," I countered. "You can be right about the need for change and still be responsible for creating unsafe conditions. Both things can be true simultaneously."

We stared at each other for a long moment, the political and personal all tangled together. Lucian had been my friend since childhood. We'd learned magic together, survived crises together, dreamed about changing the supernatural world together. But somewhere along the way, our approaches had diverged. I believed in working within the system. He was losing faith that the system could be reformed at all.

"I'll think about it," Lucian said finally. "About moderating the tone. But Elena, I need you to understand—for those of us who grew up under Terravos's occupation, who watched the old power structures fail repeatedly, patience is a luxury. Every day we wait feels like betrayal."

He walked away before I could respond, leaving me standing in the plaza surrounded by curious onlookers and the lingering sense that I'd won the argument but lost something more important.

The debrief that evening was tense.

Dad had called a small working group meeting—me, Zephyra, Mom, Lady Seraphina, and Councilor Corvinus—to discuss the Confluence District situation. Marcus stood by the door, officially security but practically a participant given how much time he spent around our research work.

"Three manifestations in two hours at a single location," Lady Seraphina said, studying the incident reports. "That's unprecedented clustering. And all during a political rally specifically criticizing Council policies."

"Correlation isn't causation," I said carefully. "The emotional stress triggered manifestations, but that's a function of the underlying magical evolution, not the political content of the speech."

"Distinction without difference," Lady Seraphina countered. "If his rallies create conditions for manifestations, they're dangerous regardless of intent. We should consider restricting such gatherings until we have better containment protocols."

"That's political censorship," I said immediately. "And it would confirm exactly what Lucian's movement believes—that the Council prioritizes controlling dissent over protecting people."

"The Council prioritizes preventing casualties," Lady Seraphina said coldly. "Your friend's rhetoric is destabilizing vulnerable individuals. That makes it a public safety issue."

"My daughter's research is making significant progress on actually addressing the root cause," Mom interjected before I could respond angrily. "Restricting political speech treats symptoms while ignoring the disease. We need faster implementation of new training methods, not suppression of legitimate advocacy."

"I agree," Dad said, and both Lady Seraphina and I looked at him in surprise. He continued: "Elena's techniques worked. She resolved a manifestation in five minutes with zero casualties. That's better than traditional methods achieve. The question isn't whether Lucian's rallies are dangerous—they clearly are given current conditions. The question is whether we solve that by restricting speech or by solving the manifestation problem itself."

"Solving the manifestation problem requires changing fundamental training approaches," Zephyra added. "Which means challenging centuries of institutional practice. That's not a quick fix."

"Then we do both," Councilor Corvinus suggested, speaking for the first time. "Expand Elena's training program immediately, get new methods into every academy and training facility. Simultaneously, work with Lucian's movement to incorporate safety protocols into their rallies—magical containment teams on standby, emotional moderation training for speakers, clear emergency procedures."

"That requires cooperation from a movement that views the Council as antagonistic," Lady Seraphina pointed out.

"Which is why Elena should be the liaison," Corvinus replied. "She has credibility with both sides, proven expertise in the techniques, and personal relationship with the movement's leadership. If anyone can bridge that divide, it's her."

Multiple pairs of eyes turned to me. I felt the weight of that attention, the expectation and responsibility all mixed together.

"I can try," I said, keeping my voice steady despite internal panic. "But I need authority to actually implement changes, not just study them. If I'm going to tell Lucian that the Council is serious about reform, I need to show results. That means accelerated approval for new training protocols, expanded resources for the research program, and visible commitment to systemic change."

"That's a significant request," Lady Seraphina said. "You're eighteen years old with two weeks of research leadership experience. Forgive my bluntness, but that's not exactly a proven track record for driving institutional transformation."

"No, but she's resolved four manifestations using techniques that work better than anything we've developed in three centuries," Zephyra said sharply. "Age is irrelevant when capability is proven. I support accelerated implementation under Elena's direction, with appropriate oversight and monitoring."

"As do I," Mom said.

"And I," Dad added. "Elena's proven she can handle the technical work. The question is whether the Council trusts her to handle the political work as well."

Silence stretched while Lady Seraphina considered. I could see her calculating—political risks versus practical benefits, traditional authority versus demonstrated competence. Finally, she nodded slowly.

"Limited accelerated implementation," she said. "New training protocols approved for immediate rollout across academy and affiliated training centers. Elena continues as research leader with authority to develop and implement containment protocols for public gatherings. But she reports progress weekly to this working group, and we maintain oversight authority if problems emerge."

"I can work with that," I said, relief flooding through me.

"Then we have consensus," Dad said. "Elena, you'll need to coordinate with academy leadership on implementation, work with Lucian on rally safety protocols, and continue refining the techniques. That's going to be a lot of work."

"Good thing I have excellent coffee and minimal need for sleep," I said, only half joking.

"And competent security who can delegate tasks appropriately," Marcus added from the door. "I'll coordinate with the academy on logistical support. You focus on the actual magical research and political bridge-building."

"Thank you," I said, meaning it. Then, turning back to the group: "I'll have implementation timeline drafted by tomorrow morning. We should be able to get initial training updates rolled out within a week, with full integration in three weeks."

"Make it happen," Dad said. "And Elena? Your mother is right—you've proven yourself capable. Trust that."

The meeting broke up, and I found myself both exhilarated and terrified. This was what I'd wanted—authority to actually implement change, chance to prove I could lead effectively, opportunity to help solve a genuine crisis. But it was also enormous responsibility, and failure would affect not just my reputation but potentially hundreds of lives.

"You okay?" Marcus asked quietly after everyone else had left. "That was a lot of pressure just loaded onto your shoulders."

"I'm fine," I said automatically, then reconsidered. "Actually, I'm terrified but trying not to show it. Better?"

"Much. Honest fear is more useful than fake confidence." He smiled slightly. "For what it's worth, you can do this. I've watched you work for two weeks now—you're brilliant at the research, natural at the teaching, and better at politics than you realize. The combination is rare."

"You've been watching me for two weeks?" I asked before I could stop myself.

"It's literally my job to watch you," Marcus said, but his expression suggested something more complicated than professional obligation. "Though I'll admit, watching you handle that manifestation today? That was impressive on levels that have nothing to do with security protocols."

We were standing very close suddenly, and I became hyperaware of the empty room, the late hour, the way Marcus was looking at me like I was someone interesting rather than just a job assignment.

"I should go draft that implementation timeline," I said, not moving.

"You should," Marcus agreed, also not moving.

Neither of us moved.

Then Zephyra's voice echoed from the hallway: "Elena! Stop flirting with security personnel and come look at these historical records. I found documentation of the last evolution period's training adaptations!"

I jumped back, face heating. "I wasn't flirting!"

"Sure," Marcus said, grinning now. "Timeline drafting. Historical records. I'll be outside providing security and definitely not thinking about anything else."

I fled toward Zephyra's voice, very deliberately not analyzing what had just almost happened or why the idea of it happening wasn't as uncomfortable as it probably should have been.

---

The next week was a blur of activity.

Implementation started immediately across all academy facilities. Every training instructor received updated protocols emphasizing emotional integration rather than suppression, with workshop sessions to practice the new techniques. Response was mixed—younger instructors adapted quickly, seeing immediate improvements with their students. Older instructors struggled, their own training so deeply rooted in traditional methods that switching paradigms felt unnatural.

"It's like asking them to speak a different language," I explained to Lucian during one of our coordination meetings about rally safety. "They intellectually understand the new approach, but their instincts default to old patterns."

"Which is exactly why systemic change is so hard," Lucian said. "The system is people, and people resist changing how they've always done things."

"But they are changing," I pointed out. "Slowly, imperfectly, but genuinely. Three instructors who were initially skeptical have completely converted after watching students succeed with the new methods. That's how change happens—person by person, success by success, until the new approach becomes the default."

"Meanwhile, how many students suffer through instructors who haven't converted yet?"

"Fewer than would suffer if we'd tried to force change all at once and created backlash that undermined everything," I replied. We'd had this conversation in various forms approximately a dozen times over the past week. Lucian wanted revolution. I believed in reform. Neither of us was entirely wrong.

"Agreed to disagree," Lucian said, his usual refrain. "But I'll acknowledge that your implementation is moving faster than I expected. And the rally safety protocols you developed are actually pretty good. My movement is willing to use them."

That was significant. Getting Lucian's movement to cooperate with Council-approved safety measures had required careful negotiation, emphasizing that the protocols were about protecting rally participants rather than restricting speech. We'd set up trained containment teams who attended rallies purely to provide rapid response if manifestations occurred, plus emotional self-regulation workshops for frequent attendees to help them recognize their own escalation patterns.

"How many rallies are you planning?" I asked.

"Two per week minimum," Lucian said. "More if situations demand it. The movement is growing, Elena. People are responding to the message about necessary change. We had five hundred people at yesterday's gathering."

"I know. I was there." I'd attended in my capacity as liaison, officially to coordinate safety protocols but practically to keep monitoring manifestation patterns. "How's the messaging moderation going?"

Lucian grimaced. "I'm trying. Focusing more on specific policy proposals, less on righteous anger. But Elena, people don't come to rallies for calm policy discussion. They come because they're frustrated, angry, ready to fight for change. If I tone down too much, I lose the energy that makes the movement effective."

"But if you don't tone down at all, you trigger manifestations that hurt the very people you're trying to help," I countered. "There has to be a balance."

"Yeah," Lucian said quietly. "I'm just not sure I've found it yet."

We worked through the logistics for the next few rallies—locations, crowd size expectations, safety team assignments. It was strange, this new dynamic between us. Still friends, but complicated by diverging philosophies and conflicting responsibilities. I was Council liaison, implementing systemic reform through institutional channels. He was movement leader, advocating for faster change through public pressure. We needed each other, but the relationship required constant navigation.

"Elena," Lucian said as we were wrapping up. "I know we disagree about approach. But I want you to know—I do see what you're accomplishing. The training changes are real. Students are reporting better control. Manifestations are decreasing. You're making genuine difference."

"Thank you," I said, surprised by the acknowledgment. "That means a lot coming from you."

"Even revolutionaries can appreciate effective reform," he said with a slight smile. "We just wish it moved faster."

"I know," I said. "Me too."

---

That evening, I finally had a chance to actually rest. Not sleep—there was too much work for proper sleep—but at least sit down with food and temporarily stop problem-solving.

Marcus found me on the academy's roof garden, where I'd retreated with a sandwich and the sunset view. He settled beside me without asking permission, which I was starting to realize was just how he operated—present without being intrusive, available without being demanding.

"You're going to burn out if you maintain this pace," he observed.

"Probably," I agreed. "But there's too much work to slow down right now."

"There's always too much work. That's the nature of important work—it's endless." Marcus pulled out his own food—some kind of elaborate wrap that looked significantly better than my basic sandwich. "But burning out doesn't help anyone. Your father learned that lesson the hard way during the Devourer crisis. Your mother made sure he learned to pace himself afterwards."

"Are you trying to give me life advice?" I asked, amused.

"I'm trying to keep you alive long enough to actually implement all these brilliant reforms," Marcus corrected. "Purely selfish motivation. If you collapse from exhaustion, I look bad at my job."

"Right. Purely professional concern."

"Absolutely."

We ate in comfortable silence for a while, watching the sun set over Nocturne. The city looked peaceful from up here, no visible signs of the various crises we were managing. It was easy to forget, in moments like this, that two weeks ago I'd been just another student. Now I was coordinating institutional reform across the entire supernatural community.

"Can I ask you something?" Marcus said eventually.

"Sure."

"Why did you take this position? Leading the manifestation research, I mean. You could have stayed in your comfortable life, let someone else handle the hard work. But you volunteered for the complicated thing. Why?"

I thought about it, trying to articulate something I'd only half-consciously understood myself.

"Because I was there when Devon had his manifestation at my party," I said finally. "I saw how terrified he was, how his magic was attacking him when it should have been his tool. And I realized... this is my generation. These are my people. If I have the ability to help and I don't use it because it's hard or uncomfortable or politically complicated, then what's the point of having that ability? Power is only meaningful if you use it for something that matters."

Marcus was quiet for a long moment. Then: "That's a very good answer."

"Thank you."

"It's also going to lead to you taking on too much responsibility and forgetting to take care of yourself," he added. "Hence my purely professional concern about your wellbeing."

"You keep saying it's purely professional," I pointed out. "I'm starting to suspect that's not entirely true."

"Maybe not entirely," Marcus admitted. "But given that I'm assigned as your security, any personal interest would be complicated at best and ethically questionable at worst. So I'm choosing to focus on the professional aspects and definitely not thinking about anything else."

"That's very disciplined of you."

"I'm a very disciplined person."

"I've noticed."

We were definitely flirting now, and I should probably stop, but I was too tired to care about should probably. Marcus was interesting, capable, and seemed to genuinely respect what I was trying to accomplish. That was rare enough to be worth exploring, even if the timing was terrible and the situation was complicated.

"Elena," Marcus said, more seriously now. "I meant what I said earlier. You're doing incredible work. Don't let the difficulty of it make you doubt yourself."

"I'm terrified I'm going to screw this up," I admitted. "That I'm too young, too inexperienced, too naive to actually pull off systemic change. That people are going to get hurt because I wasn't good enough."

"That fear means you're taking it seriously," Marcus said. "The people who scare me are the ones who aren't afraid of screwing up. But Elena, from what I've seen? You're not going to fail. You're too smart, too dedicated, and too willing to ask for help when you need it. That's a pretty solid foundation for success."

"You sound very certain."

"I'm good at reading people. It's part of what makes me effective at security work. And you?" He met my eyes directly. "You're going to change the supernatural world. I can see it."

I wanted to protest, to say he was overestimating me, to deflect the confidence I didn't quite feel myself. But something about how he said it—certain, matter-of-fact, without flattery or exaggeration—made me believe it might actually be true.

"Thank you," I said quietly. "For believing that."

"Anytime," Marcus replied. "Now finish your sandwich and get at least six hours of sleep. Doctor's orders."

"You're not a doctor."

"Security expert orders, then. Still nonnegotiable."

I laughed, tension easing slightly. "I'll try."

"Good enough," Marcus said. "Come on. I'll walk you back to your quarters and make sure you actually go to bed instead of sneaking back to the research facility."

"That was one time."

"It was four times that I caught you. Who knows how many times you managed it when I wasn't paying attention."

"Purely professional observation, right?"

"Absolutely. Nothing personal about it whatsoever."

We headed inside together, and despite the exhaustion and the pressure and the looming challenges, I felt something close to contentment. The work was hard. The politics were complicated. My friendship with Lucian was strained. But I was making genuine progress on something that mattered, and I had people around me who believed I could succeed.

It was enough.

For now, it was enough.
