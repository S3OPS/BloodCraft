The Council reform proposal sat on my desk like an accusation.

Twelve pages of carefully worded policy changes, each one designed to address younger supernatural beings' concerns while maintaining institutional stability. Representation quotas ensuring voices under thirty had guaranteed Council seats. Updated training standards incorporating emotional integration techniques. Streamlined approval processes for new methodologies. On paper, it was everything Lucian's movement had been demanding.

In practice, it was compromise—real progress, but incremental rather than revolutionary. And I had no idea how to sell it to people who'd stopped believing compromise was enough.

"You look like you're contemplating murder," Tessa said, appearing in my office doorway with vampire silence. "Should I be worried?"

"Only if bureaucratic language counts as a war crime," I muttered. "The Council approved the reform package. I'm supposed to present it to Lucian's movement as evidence of good faith. But I keep imagining the response."

"'Too little, too late, typical Council half-measures'?" Tessa guessed, settling into the chair across from my desk. "Yeah, I can see that going poorly. Though to be fair, the proposals aren't nothing. Guaranteed youth representation is actually pretty significant."

"I know. That's what makes this so frustrating." I pushed the document toward her. "This is genuine progress, Tessa. Real structural change that will make material difference in how supernatural community operates. But because it's not immediate revolution, it'll be dismissed as inadequate."

"So make them see why it matters," Tessa said simply. "You're good at that—explaining complex things in ways people actually understand. Just... do that. Show them this isn't token gestures, it's foundation for sustained transformation."

I wanted to believe it was that simple. But I'd watched the rallies grow increasingly radical over the past few weeks, seen Lucian's messaging shift from reform advocacy to barely-disguised calls for institutional dismantling. The movement was evolving beyond compromise, and I wasn't sure careful explanations would penetrate that ideological momentum.

"Elena." Marcus's voice from the hallway, urgent enough to cut through my spiraling thoughts. "We have a situation."

I stood immediately, blood magic already rising instinctively. "Manifestation?"

"Worse. Political confrontation that's about to become physical. Lucian's movement is occupying the Council building's main entrance. They're demanding immediate implementation of their full reform agenda, and they're not accepting 'no' as an answer."

"Shit." I grabbed my jacket, mind already racing through crisis response protocols. "How many people?"

"Two hundred, maybe more arriving. Mix of young Blood Archons, Fire Archons, even some werewolves and witches. Cross-factional unity, which would be impressive if it wasn't currently blocking official government operations." Marcus fell into step beside me as we headed for the exit. "Your father is trying to negotiate, but it's not going well. Lucian specifically requested your presence."

Of course he did. Because I was the bridge—Council authority and generational peer, Dad's daughter and Lucian's friend, reformist and revolutionary simultaneously. The position I'd thought was strategic asset was rapidly becoming impossible weight.

We emerged from the research facility into chaos. The Council building's grand entrance was indeed blocked by bodies—young supernatural beings forming human barricade, arms linked, chanting slogans about systemic change. "Reform Now, Not Later!" "Youth Voices Matter!" "Dismantle Power Structures!" The energy was electric, passionate, and dangerously close to violent.

Dad stood on the Council building steps, projecting calm authority despite visible tension. Several Council members flanked him, including Lady Seraphina looking distinctly unimpressed. And in front of the crowd, leading the occupation, was Lucian—my childhood friend, brilliant researcher, increasingly radical advocate.

Our eyes met across the crowd, and I saw conflict there matching my own. He didn't want this confrontation any more than I did. But we'd both been pulled by forces larger than personal friendship—him by movement momentum, me by institutional responsibility.

"Elena," Dad said as I reached the steps. "Thank you for coming. Perhaps you can help us find resolution before this escalates further."

"What are their specific demands?" I asked, keeping my voice professional despite internal churning.

"Immediate implementation of all movement proposals," Lady Seraphina said coldly. "Complete restructuring of Council authority, mandatory term limits, youth veto power over traditional leadership decisions. Essentially, dismantling governance structures that have maintained stability for centuries."

"We're demanding accountability," Lucian called from his position. "The Council has had months to address our concerns. Instead, you offer token reforms while maintaining the same power structures that caused problems in the first place. We're done waiting for permission to have our voices matter."

"The Council approved comprehensive reform package three days ago," I said, loud enough for everyone to hear. "Guaranteed youth representation, updated training standards, streamlined approval processes for new methodologies. Real structural change addressing legitimate concerns while maintaining institutional stability necessary for community function."

"Maintenance of institutional stability means maintenance of power for people who've held it for centuries," Lucian countered. "Your reforms preserve the hierarchy while claiming to address inequality. That's not transformation, Elena. That's appeasement."

"It's foundation for sustained change," I shot back. "You can't dismantle everything at once without creating chaos that hurts the very people you claim to be helping. Incremental reform with popular support is how you build lasting transformation."

"Incremental reform is how you delay transformation until momentum dies and nothing actually changes," Lucian replied. "How many times in history have marginalized groups been told to be patient, to accept small changes, to trust the process? And how many times has that patience been used to preserve status quo?"

He wasn't wrong. The historical pattern he described was real, documented, tragically common. Marginalized groups told to wait, accept incremental change, trust institutional good faith—only to find that patience exploited and promises forgotten once immediate pressure subsided.

But it was also true that revolutionary change without foundation often collapsed into chaos, replaced one tyranny with another, left people worse off than they'd been before. Both patterns were real. Both risks were legitimate. And I was caught between them with no clear path forward.

"Lucian," I said, more quietly but projecting enough for the crowd to hear. "I know you're frustrated. I'm frustrated too. The pace of change feels glacial when people are suffering now. But this occupation? It's not going to accelerate reform. It's going to trigger backlash, give ammunition to people who want to dismiss your entire movement as radical extremists, undermine the progress we've actually achieved. Please don't throw away everything we've built because it's not moving fast enough."

"What have we built, Elena?" Lucian challenged. "You keep talking about progress, about foundation, about sustained transformation. But while we're building that carefully measured progress, how many more young supernatural beings have wild manifestations? How many get hurt because the training methods are still primarily traditional despite your research proving they don't work? How many are told to be patient while the very techniques that would help them are locked behind bureaucratic approval processes?"

"Seventeen," I said, the number burning in my mind. "Seventeen manifestations in the past three weeks despite implementation of new training methods at every facility. Down from sixty-eight the month before the changes. Your occupation is making that progress harder, not easier."

The crowd murmured, and I saw Lucian falter slightly. He hadn't known the specific numbers, hadn't realized that our reforms were actually working despite being incremental. But he recovered quickly, pivoting his argument.

"Seventeen is still seventeen too many," he said. "And you're proving my point—your reforms are working, but they're not implemented fast enough or broadly enough. If the Council had acted immediately when the crisis began instead of requiring months of study and careful consensus-building, how many of those seventeen could have been prevented?"

"If we'd implemented untested methods immediately without research or validation, we might have made things worse," I countered. "Innovation requires iteration. You can't skip the testing phase just because you're impatient."

"This isn't impatience, it's urgency. There's a difference."

"Is there?" I felt my frustration crystallizing into something sharper. "Because from where I'm standing, you're so focused on the urgency that you've stopped thinking strategically. This occupation undermines everything we've accomplished together, Lucian. It confirms every fear the traditionalists have about your movement being destructive rather than constructive. You're handing Lady Seraphina and her allies exactly the ammunition they need to resist further reforms."

"Then maybe they were never going to support real change anyway," Lucian said. "Maybe we've been wasting time trying to compromise with people who will always find reasons to preserve their own authority."

"Or maybe you've stopped being able to distinguish between legitimate institutional caution and active resistance," I shot back. "The Council approved significant reforms three days ago. Three days! You didn't even wait to see them implemented before deciding they were inadequate and launching this occupation. That's not justice-seeking, Lucian. That's just being unwilling to accept anything less than complete victory on your exact terms."

Silence fell across the plaza, tense and charged. I'd gone too far, crossed from diplomatic bridge-building into personal attack. But I was so tired of being careful, of navigating impossible balance between irreconcilable positions, of being blamed by both sides for not going far enough or going too far.

"You sound exactly like your father," Lucian said quietly, and the crowd rumbled approval. "Same arguments, same philosophy, same belief that working within the system is inherently righteous. Tell me, Elena—at what point do you acknowledge that the system itself is the problem? How many more generations have to wait for the incremental reforms you believe in before supernatural society actually becomes equitable?"

"At what point do you acknowledge that destroying systems without replacement plans creates suffering?" I challenged back. "You want revolution, fine. What's your governing structure once Council authority is dismantled? How do you maintain community coordination without hierarchical frameworks? What prevents your new system from replicating the exact power dynamics you're fighting against? Or have you not actually thought that far ahead because revolution sounds more romantic than governance?"

"We have detailed proposals—" Lucian started.

"You have ideological principles," I interrupted. "That's not the same as operational frameworks for managing a diverse community with competing interests. I've read your movement's documents, Lucian. They're brilliant on problems and vague on solutions. That's not enough to rebuild society."

Before Lucian could respond, I felt it—the now-familiar surge of wild magic, but different this time. Not one person's power cycling out of control, but multiple simultaneous manifestations rippling through the crowd like dominoes. The emotional intensity of the confrontation had created exactly the conditions for mass instability.

"Everyone down!" I shouted, power flaring as I wove containment structures. But there were too many sources, too much magical energy all destabilizing at once. I couldn't contain them all alone.

Dad's power joined mine instantly, massive Prime Archon capability reinforcing my containment weaving. Mom materialized beside us, her ancient experience adding precision to raw power. Together, we created network of containment fields, individual structures for each manifestation, careful not to suppress too hard and trigger backlash.

But it was Marcus who actually prevented casualties.

He moved through the crowd with hybrid speed and instinct, guiding people away from the most dangerous manifestations, physically shielding bystanders when containment fields faltered, coordinating with other security personnel to establish safe zones. His werewolf nature gave him strength and speed, his witch heritage provided magical perception, and his training made him effective in ways that transcended individual abilities.

Within ten minutes, we had all manifestations contained and victims stabilized. But the damage was done. Three people seriously injured from proximity to uncontrolled magic, dozen more with minor burns or cuts, everyone terrified and traumatized. And the entire event had been caused by a political confrontation that never should have escalated to this point.

"This is what I've been trying to tell you," I said to Lucian, exhausted and angry and heartbroken all at once. "This. High-intensity emotional situations create conditions for manifestations. Your occupation wasn't just political theater—it was actively dangerous. And now three people are hurt because neither of us could find a way to de-escalate."

Lucian looked stricken, staring at the injured being tended by medical personnel. "I didn't... I was careful about rally safety protocols—"

"Rallies are planned events with containment teams ready," I said. "This was spontaneous occupation with no safety measures. You created exactly the conditions I warned about, and people paid the price."

"Elena." Dad's hand on my shoulder, gentle but firm. "That's enough. Lucian understands the consequences. Publicly blaming him further doesn't help."

"Doesn't help what?" I demanded, rounding on my father. "The occupation that shouldn't have happened? The reforms that weren't implemented fast enough? The impossible position where I'm somehow supposed to satisfy both the Council demanding institutional stability and the movement demanding revolutionary change? What exactly am I supposed to be helping with here, Dad?"

Dad looked at me with understanding and sadness. "Your own frustration. This situation is impossible by design—you're caught between legitimate competing interests with no perfect solution. But taking that frustration out on Lucian, or on me, doesn't make the impossible possible. It just burns bridges you'll need later."

He was right. I knew he was right. But the rightness didn't make me less angry or frustrated or exhausted from trying to hold together things that didn't want to be held.

"I need a break," I said, voice tight. "Someone else can handle the debrief. I'm going home."

I left before anyone could respond, Marcus falling into step beside me without being asked. We walked in silence back to my quarters, and I appreciated that he didn't try to fill the space with reassurances or advice. Sometimes presence was enough.

---

My apartment at the academy was small but comfortable—living room, bedroom, bathroom, tiny kitchen I barely used. I'd moved in six months ago when it became clear I was essentially living at the research facility anyway. Having private space separate from my parents' estate had been important for establishing independence.

Right now it just felt lonely.

"You should eat something," Marcus said, investigating my depressingly empty refrigerator. "Though based on this inventory, I'm guessing you usually eat at the cafeteria."

"Or research facility," I admitted, collapsing onto my couch. "Cooking feels wasteful when I'm working sixteen-hour days."

"That's not sustainable." Marcus emerged with ingredients I'd forgotten I had and began assembling something that might become food. "You're going to burn out."

"Everyone keeps saying that."

"Because it's true." He moved around my kitchen with surprising competence, chopping vegetables with precision. "Elena, I know you're trying to save the world. But you're not actually required to sacrifice yourself in the process. Martyrdom isn't productive."

"I'm not being a martyr," I protested. "I'm just doing what needs to be done."

"At the expense of sleep, food, rest, and apparently all social life outside of crisis management." Marcus pointed a knife at me, not threateningly but emphasizing his point. "That's martyrdom. Or at least martyrdom-adjacent. Either way, it's unsustainable."

"What am I supposed to do?" I asked, frustration bleeding into my voice. "People are getting hurt. I have the ability to help. Should I just ignore that because I'm tired?"

"You should acknowledge that helping requires being functional," Marcus countered. "A burned-out Elena helps no one. A rested, healthy Elena who maintains boundaries and takes care of herself can actually sustain effort long-term. Revolutionary concept, I know."

I wanted to argue, but the apartment smelled amazing and I realized I hadn't eaten since breakfast eight hours ago. My stomach growled traitorously, undermining any claim that I was taking adequate care of myself.

"What are you making?" I asked instead of continuing the losing argument.

"Stir-fry. Easy, fast, nutritious, and requires minimal kitchen competence." Marcus had everything organized with military precision, vegetables cut uniformly, sauce ingredients measured out. "My mother insisted I learn to cook properly before leaving home. Said it was critical survival skill more important than most magic."

"Your mother sounds wise."

"She's a witch who raised hybrid son in werewolf-dominated pack," Marcus said with dry amusement. "Wisdom was survival requirement. She taught me that being caught between two worlds meant learning from both rather than belonging fully to either."

There was something in his tone—casual words hiding deeper meaning. I sat up straighter, paying closer attention.

"Is that hard?" I asked. "Being hybrid? Never fully fitting either world?"

Marcus was quiet for a moment, focused on cooking. Then: "Sometimes. Werewolves see me as too witch. Witches see me as too werewolf. Neither community fully claims me, so I learned to claim myself. Built identity from synthesis rather than trying to choose one side over the other."

"That sounds lonely."

"It was, for a while." He glanced back at me, something vulnerable in his expression. "But it also gave me perspective. I understand both worlds because I'm not entirely committed to either. That makes me good at what I do—security work requires seeing from multiple angles, anticipating threats from different cultural frameworks. My hybrid nature is asset, not liability. Just took me a while to realize that."

I thought about my own position—Council liaison and movement sympathizer, Dad's daughter and Elena in my own right, reformist and revolutionary simultaneously. Caught between worlds, trying to build bridge between irreconcilable positions. Maybe that wasn't failure. Maybe that was strategic positioning.

"Thank you," I said quietly. "For sharing that."

"Anytime." Marcus dished up two plates of stir-fry that looked restaurant-quality. "Now eat. Doctor's orders."

"Still not a doctor."

"Security expert with strong opinions about proper nutrition, then. Eat."

I ate. It was delicious, and I hadn't realized how hungry I was until food hit my system. We ate in comfortable silence, and gradually I felt some of the day's tension ease.

"I screwed up today," I said eventually. "The confrontation with Lucian. I let frustration override strategy, said things that made the situation worse instead of better. That's not effective bridge-building."

"You're human," Marcus said simply. "Or, well, supernatural. But point stands—you're allowed to have emotional reactions to impossible situations. The expectation that you should perfectly navigate every crisis without ever losing composure is unrealistic."

"Dad manages it."

"Your father has twenty years more practice and has made plenty of mistakes along the way," Marcus pointed out. "You've been in leadership role for one month. Give yourself time to learn."

"People don't have time for me to learn on the job," I said. "They're getting hurt now."

"And you're helping them now," Marcus countered. "Imperfectly, but genuinely. That's all anyone can ask. Stop comparing yourself to some imaginary standard of perfection and measure yourself against actual progress—manifestations are down, training is improving, reforms are being implemented. You're succeeding, Elena. You're just too tired to see it."

I wanted to believe him. Logically, I knew the numbers showed progress. But it felt like failure when people were still getting hurt, when my best friend was radicalizing, when I couldn't find compromise that satisfied anyone.

"Come here," Marcus said suddenly, setting down his plate and moving to sit beside me on the couch. "You look like you could use a hug, and I'm deciding that falls under security responsibilities."

"That's definitely not in your job description," I said, but I didn't pull away when he wrapped arms around me.

He was warm and solid and steady, and I hadn't realized how much I needed human contact until I had it. I leaned into the embrace, letting myself rest against someone else's strength for a moment. Marcus's hand rubbed small circles on my back, soothing without demanding, present without overwhelming.

"Better?" he asked after a minute.

"Yeah," I admitted. "Though now I'm worried about becoming dependent on security personnel for emotional support."

"I'll allow it," Marcus said, and I could hear the smile in his voice. "Purely professional emotional support, of course. Nothing personal whatsoever."

"Of course."

We stayed like that for a while, not talking, just existing together. Eventually, I pulled back, meeting his eyes. He was looking at me with expression I was starting to recognize—professional concern layered over something deeper, more complicated, more interesting.

"Marcus," I started, not sure what I was going to say.

"Elena," he replied, equally uncertain.

Before either of us could figure out where that sentence was going, my communication crystal chimed urgently—emergency Council summons. I checked the message and felt my stomach drop.

"What is it?" Marcus asked, reading my expression.

"Lady Seraphina is calling emergency vote to revoke the reform package," I said, already standing and grabbing my jacket. "She's citing today's occupation and manifestations as evidence that rapid change creates instability. If she succeeds, we lose everything we've accomplished over the past month."

"When's the vote?"

"Now. Council is convening in twenty minutes." I was already moving toward the door. "I need to get there, present counter-arguments, somehow convince them that today was aberration rather than pattern."

"I'll come with you," Marcus said, falling into step. "Security purposes."

"Right. Security purposes."

We headed out into the night, and despite exhaustion and frustration and looming political crisis, I felt steadier. Marcus was right—I couldn't solve everything perfectly. But I could keep showing up, keep fighting for progress, keep building bridges even when they felt impossible.

That would have to be enough.

---

The emergency Council session was every bit as contentious as I'd feared.

Lady Seraphina had assembled impressive coalition of traditionalists, all arguing that today's events proved the danger of rapid reform. "We moved too fast," she was saying as I entered the chamber. "Granted too much too quickly to appease radical elements, and this is the result—occupation, confrontation, injuries. The manifestations that occurred were directly caused by the political instability our reforms created."

"The manifestations were caused by the underlying magical evolution," I countered, moving to the speaker's position. "Today's injuries were tragic, but they were not caused by the reforms themselves. If anything, our training updates prevented worse casualties—three injured rather than dozens dead."

"That's speculation," Councilor Ashfall said. "What we know for certain is that since implementing your experimental techniques, political radicalism has increased, culminating in today's occupation. The correlation is clear."

"Correlation isn't causation," I replied, repeating the phrase I'd heard directed at my own research dozens of times. "Political activism increased because younger generation has legitimate grievances that we're finally acknowledging. The reforms didn't cause that activism—they provided evidence that institutional change is possible, which naturally encourages advocacy for further change."

"Semantics," Lady Seraphina said dismissively. "The practical result is instability. I'm proposing we suspend the reform package implementation, return to proven traditional methods, and reconsider structural changes only after careful additional study period."

"That's capitulation to fear," Dad said, speaking for the first time. "And it will accomplish exactly nothing except confirming Lucian's movement's belief that the Council never intended genuine reform. You'll radicalize moderates and validate extremists simultaneously."

"Or we'll restore stability and demonstrate that institutional authority still exists," Lady Seraphina countered. "Your daughter has done commendable work, Balance, but she's eighteen years old leading experimental program with massive societal implications. Perhaps we moved too quickly giving her such authority."

I felt the words like physical blow—dismissal based on age rather than capability, questioning of my competence wrapped in superficial politeness. This was what I'd been fighting against, the assumption that youth meant incompetence, that traditional authority trumped demonstrated success.

"My age is irrelevant to whether the techniques work," I said, keeping my voice level despite anger. "The data shows manifestation rates dropping, control improving, casualties decreasing. Those are facts independent of my birthday."

"But are they sustainable facts?" Councilor Corvinus asked—and surprisingly, his tone was genuinely curious rather than dismissive. "What Lady Seraphina is asking, I think, is whether your success is replicable across broader population or whether it requires your specific abilities to implement effectively."

That was actually a fair question. I'd been personally handling most manifestation containments because I was good at it, but that wasn't scalable. If the techniques only worked with Prime Archon-level power, they weren't real solution to systemic problem.

"We've trained seventeen instructors in the new methods over the past three weeks," I said. "All seventeen report successful application with their students. Not as rapid as my personal interventions, but effective. The techniques work independent of my involvement—they just require proper training in emotional integration approaches rather than traditional suppression methods."

"Seventeen instructors is not broad validation," Lady Seraphina said. "That's barely pilot program."

"Which is why the reform package included expanded training initiatives," Mom interjected. "We're not claiming to have perfected solution—we're acknowledging that evolution requires adaptation and providing framework for that adaptation. Revoking the reforms now would be abandoning the work before it has chance to succeed."

"Or it would be preventing further damage from insufficient validation," Lady Seraphina countered. "I'm calling the vote. All in favor of suspending reform package pending additional study period?"

Hands went up—not a majority, but close. Too close. I watched the count anxiously, trying to calculate political alignments. Lady Seraphina had seven confirmed votes. She needed nine for majority. If even two more Council members sided with her...

"All opposed?" Dad asked, his voice tight.

More hands, thank the ancestors. Not overwhelming majority, but enough. The reform package would stand. For now.

"Motion fails," Dad announced. "The reforms continue as planned. However." He looked around the chamber significantly. "Lady Seraphina raises legitimate concerns about validation scale. Elena, I'm tasking you with expanding the instructor training program immediately. We need broader implementation to demonstrate these techniques work independent of your personal involvement."

"I can do that," I said, relieved and terrified simultaneously. Expanded training meant more work, more coordination, more pressure. But it also meant proving the reforms were genuinely sustainable.

"You'll need additional resources," Zephyra said. "I'm volunteering to co-lead the training expansion. Between Elena's innovative approaches and my institutional knowledge, we should be able to scale effectively."

"I'll support that allocation," Corvinus said, and several other Council members nodded agreement.

Lady Seraphina looked displeased but didn't push further. She'd lost this vote, but she'd demonstrated she had support for skepticism. The political landscape was shifting, and not necessarily in our favor.

The meeting continued for another hour, hammering out details and timelines. By the time we adjourned, I was exhausted but cautiously optimistic. We'd survived the immediate crisis. The reforms would continue. And I had buy-in from enough Council members to keep moving forward.

But Lady Seraphina's challenge had revealed something troubling—the coalition supporting reforms was fragile, dependent on continued success without major setbacks. One significant failure, and we'd lose everything.

---

I found Lucian waiting outside the Council building when I finally emerged well past midnight. He looked as exhausted as I felt, conflict written across his familiar features.

"I heard the vote," he said quietly. "Your reforms survived."

"Barely," I replied. "And only because we promised expanded validation. One major failure and Lady Seraphina gets to say 'I told you so' while dismantling everything we've built."

"I'm sorry," Lucian said, and he sounded like he meant it. "For today. For the occupation. For the manifestations. I didn't think it through properly. I was so focused on applying pressure that I didn't consider the consequences."

"I know," I said. "And I'm sorry too. For attacking you publicly. For letting frustration override strategy. For being unable to find compromise that works for both sides."

"Maybe there isn't compromise that works," Lucian said sadly. "Maybe we've reached the point where we're fighting for incompatible visions and friendship can't bridge that gap."

"I refuse to believe that," I said firmly. "We disagree on tactics, not goals. You want sustainable change through pressure. I want sustainable change through consensus. Both approaches have merit. We just need to find way to coordinate rather than working at cross-purposes."

"How?" Lucian asked, genuinely curious. "How do we coordinate when every action I take to increase pressure undermines your efforts to build consensus, and every compromise you negotiate to maintain consensus undermines my ability to sustain movement momentum?"

It was good question. Excellent question, actually. And I didn't have a good answer.

"I don't know," I admitted. "But I know that giving up on finding answer means accepting that we're opponents rather than allies with different approaches. And I'm not ready to do that yet. Are you?"

Lucian was quiet for long moment, studying my face in the dim light. Then he smiled slightly—sad, conflicted, but genuine.

"No," he said. "I'm not ready either. So I guess we keep trying, even when it feels impossible."

"Even when it feels impossible," I agreed.

We stood there in the darkness, two friends caught between competing loyalties, neither of us certain we could find a path forward but both too stubborn to stop trying. It wasn't resolution. It wasn't even really comfort.

But it was something. And sometimes, something was enough to keep going.
