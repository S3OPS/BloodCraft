The Evolution Coalition's first policy presentation to the Council was scheduled for three days from now, and I still didn't know whether to include my discovery about magical evolution's fundamental nature.

"You're overthinking this," Marcus said, watching me pace the research facility's main lab. "The data is clear. The theory explains everything. Present it."

"And risk confirming every fear traditionalists have about youth movement being revolutionary?" I countered. "Dad warned me about burning political capital, Zephyra said some truths are politically unsustainable. Maybe I should wait, build more support first."

"Or maybe you should trust that evidence speaks for itself," Marcus replied. "You've spent two months building reputation as evidence-based reformer. That's your political capital—credibility from being right and being able to prove it. This discovery reinforces that credibility rather than undermining it."

He wasn't wrong. My coalition formed specifically around evidence-based reform. Suppressing major finding because it was politically uncomfortable would undermine that entire foundation. But presenting it would create exactly the revolutionary-versus-reformist crisis I'd been trying to avoid.

"The traditionalists will say it proves we want to dismantle existing authority structures," I said.

"They already say that," Marcus pointed out. "The question is whether your coalition and moderate Council members believe evidence over political rhetoric. That's where your actual support base is—people who care about what works rather than what preserves existing power. Present the data, let them decide based on evidence rather than trying to manage their reactions preemptively."

"That's remarkably idealistic for someone who just lectured me about pragmatism over principles."

"It's not idealistic—it's strategic," Marcus corrected. "Your political power comes from being right and proving it. This discovery is both. Using it strengthens your position rather than weakening it, assuming you present it properly."

"And if I'm wrong about that?"

"Then you lose your political authority and we figure out next steps," Marcus said with frustrating calm. "But operating from fear of potential failure is guaranteed way to accomplish nothing. Risk is inherent to leadership. The question is whether this risk is worth taking."

I turned back to the data displays, showing the clear pattern of how evolved magic operated through collaborative alignment rather than hierarchical control. The implications were revolutionary—suggesting traditional authority structures were fundamentally mismatched to younger generation's capabilities. But the evidence was undeniable.

"I'm going to include it," I decided. "Full theoretical framework, supporting data, implications clearly stated. If that destroys my political authority, at least I'll have been honest about what the evidence shows."

"That's my Elena," Marcus said approvingly. "Leading with integrity even when it's terrifying."

"It's absolutely terrifying," I admitted.

"Good. That means you're taking it seriously rather than being reckless." He stood, moving to stand behind me. "But you're not doing this alone. Your coalition supports you, the data supports you, and I support you. Trust that foundation rather than borrowing trouble from hypothetical opposition."

I leaned back against him, drawing comfort from solid presence. "When did you become my emotional support system?"

"Somewhere between watching you negotiate impossible political situations and realizing you're the most remarkable person I've ever met," Marcus said quietly. "Probably shouldn't have admitted that—makes me sound invested rather than objectively supportive."

"You are invested," I said, turning to face him. "That's not weakness. That's…" I trailed off, not quite ready to name what this was becoming between us.

"Partnership," Marcus supplied. "We're building something here—not just political coalition, but actual foundation for different kind of leadership. Evidence-based, collaborative, willing to follow data rather than ideology. That matters. You matter. And yes, I'm invested in seeing you succeed."

"Partnership," I echoed, testing the word. It felt right in ways that terrified me almost as much as the upcoming Council presentation. "I can work with that."

"Good. Now finish your presentation. We have revolutionary discovery to announce properly."

The Council chamber was packed when we arrived three days later.

Not just Council members—representatives from every faction, academy faculty, reform movement observers including Lucian, and what looked like half the politically engaged supernatural community under thirty. Word had spread that the Evolution Coalition was presenting major findings, and everyone wanted to be present.

"This is more attention than I was prepared for," I muttered to Sera Fireflight as we set up our presentation materials.

"You formed political coalition and promised evidence-based revolution," Sera replied. "People want to know if you can deliver or if it's just rhetoric. Consider this your proof-of-concept moment."

"No pressure, then."

"Enormous pressure," Sera agreed cheerfully. "But you thrive under pressure. It's kind of your thing."

The Council called the session to order, and Lady Seraphina took her position as senior Council member opposing rapid reform. She'd been building her own coalition over the past weeks—traditionalists who viewed any youth-led change as threat to established order. This presentation was test of strength between our competing visions.

"The Council recognizes Elena Sixxx-Darkpurr and the Evolution Coalition," Viktor announced formally. "You have requested time to present findings regarding magical manifestation patterns in younger supernatural beings. Proceed."

I took center position, projecting the first display onto the chamber's walls. "Thank you. Over the past two months, we've been analyzing wild manifestation patterns and the effectiveness of different training approaches. Our findings explain not just the immediate phenomenon, but the underlying cause of generational divide in supernatural society."

Murmurs rippled through the chamber. I'd just claimed to explain major sociological pattern through magical theory—that was bold statement requiring substantial evidence.

"Traditional magical training operates on hierarchical control model," I continued, displaying comparative data. "The practitioner imposes their will on power, directing it through structured channels, forcing reality to comply with conscious intent. This approach has been effective for thousands of years across all factions. However, analysis of younger practitioners—those under approximately twenty-five years old—shows fundamentally different magical signature."

I brought up the comparative analyses, showing the stark difference between control-based and what I was terming alignment-based magic. The visual evidence was undeniable.

"Younger practitioners' magic operates through collaborative alignment rather than hierarchical control," I explained. "Instead of imposing will on power, they recognize existing patterns in reality and align their consciousness with those patterns, allowing manifestation to emerge from harmony rather than force. It's not weaker or less sophisticated—it's fundamentally different operational framework."

"That's interesting theory," Lady Seraphina said, tone making clear she found it anything but interesting. "However, different magical expressions have always existed. Individual variation is normal. You're claiming this represents generational shift rather than simple diversity."

"Correct," I said, prepared for this challenge. "Because the pattern is consistent across factions, geographic regions, and family lines. It's not individual variation—it's systematic transformation affecting entire age cohort. And critically, it correlates precisely with effectiveness of different training approaches."

I displayed success rates, showing how traditional suppression techniques triggered resistance cycles in younger practitioners while emotional integration approaches succeeded. Then I showed how the opposite pattern held for older practitioners—control techniques worked well, while pure alignment approaches were less effective for those trained in hierarchical frameworks.

"The training method effectiveness directly correlates with underlying magical operation mode," I said. "This isn't about better or worse approaches—it's about matched versus mismatched frameworks. Traditional training fails younger practitioners not because the training is wrong, but because it's designed for different type of magic than they're actually manifesting."

"You're suggesting our training methods are obsolete," Corvinus observed, not quite accusatory but clearly concerned.

"I'm suggesting our training methods are mismatched for younger practitioners while remaining appropriate for traditional magic users," I corrected. "The solution isn't abandoning hierarchical approaches—it's developing complementary alignment-based methods. Both frameworks are valid. The problem is requiring everyone to operate through single framework when two fundamentally different types of magic are manifesting."

"And you have evidence this is magical evolution rather than cultural shift or political rebellion disguised as magical difference?" Lady Seraphina challenged.

"Yes," I said, pulling up historical records Zephyra had helped me analyze. "Because this isn't first time it's happened. Approximately every thousand years, similar shifts appear in historical records. Previous Archon generations documented periods where younger practitioners manifested differently, causing social disruption until new training methods developed. The pattern repeats across multiple millennia."

That caused significant reaction. I'd just claimed this was predictable evolutionary cycle rather than unprecedented crisis.

"If this is cyclical," someone called from the observing section, "why weren't we prepared? Why did it cause problems this time?"

"Because the last cycle occurred roughly twelve hundred years ago," I explained. "We lost institutional memory. The records exist in ancient archives, but nobody was actively monitoring for evolutionary patterns because we hadn't experienced one in living memory—even for long-lived species. We were caught unprepared not because it's unprecedented, but because we forgot it happens."

I let that sink in for a moment before continuing. "The implications are significant. This isn't youth rebellion or political agitation—it's biological magical evolution. Younger generation isn't choosing to be difficult. Their magic literally operates differently. Requiring them to conform to hierarchical training frameworks is like requiring water to be solid at room temperature. You can apply pressure and lower temperature and sometimes force it to work, but the natural state is different and forcing conformity requires constant energy and creates constant resistance."

"You're making very large claims," Viktor said carefully. "That traditional authority structures are fundamentally incompatible with evolved magic users. That's not just training methodology—that's social organization, governance, cultural frameworks. You're claiming thousands of years of supernatural society structure needs fundamental revision."

"I'm claiming that maintaining purely hierarchical governance structures while significant portion of population manifests collaborative magic creates inherent tension," I said. "Not that hierarchy is wrong—that requiring everyone to operate through single framework when two fundamentally different magical types exist creates inevitable conflict. The solution is developing hybrid governance that accommodates both operational modes."

"That's revolutionary change," Lady Seraphina said sharply. "You're asking us to dismantle existing authority structures based on theory about magical differences."

"I'm asking us to adapt governance to match population capabilities," I countered. "And it's not theory—it's documented pattern supported by extensive data. The evidence is comprehensive, the historical precedent is clear, and the solution is addition rather than replacement. We're not dismantling hierarchy—we're developing collaborative frameworks alongside it."

"And who decides how this 'hybrid governance' operates?" Lady Seraphina challenged. "You? Your coalition? The reform movement? Convenient timing for this discovery just as you're building political power base."

"The discovery isn't convenient—it's explanatory," I said, keeping voice level despite the anger rising. "It explains why traditional training methods are failing, why younger practitioners experience resistance to hierarchical authority, why emotional integration approaches succeed. You can question my motives, but you can't question the data. It's comprehensive, it's verifiable, and it's conclusive. If you doubt the findings, examine the evidence yourself rather than attacking my political positioning."

"I'm questioning whether revolutionary social claims should be accepted based solely on evidence presented by person who benefits politically from those claims being accepted," Lady Seraphina replied.

"Then propose alternative explanation for the data," I challenged. "Scientific method doesn't require trusting the researcher—it requires verifying the findings. If my theory is wrong, demonstrate why. If the data is flawed, show the flaws. But don't dismiss comprehensive evidence because you find the implications politically uncomfortable."

Silence fell as Lady Seraphina had no immediate response to that. Because she couldn't—the data was solid, the analysis was sound, and the pattern was undeniable. She could question my motives, but she couldn't refute the evidence.

"I propose independent review," Viktor suggested diplomatically. "Council forms committee to verify these findings through replication studies. If the pattern holds across independent analysis, we proceed with developing hybrid frameworks. If discrepancies appear, we revise the theory. That's appropriate response to major scientific claim—verification before implementation."

"That's acceptable," I agreed immediately. Independent review strengthened my position rather than weakening it, because the evidence would hold up under scrutiny. "I'll provide all research data, methodology, and analysis to the review committee. Complete transparency."

"As will academy research division," Zephyra added from her Council position. "We've been conducting parallel analysis and reached similar conclusions independently. This isn't single researcher's theory—it's converging evidence from multiple investigation streams."

That was significant endorsement. Zephyra supporting the findings publicly meant they had her three-thousand-year expertise backing them. Lady Seraphina's skepticism became substantially less credible in face of ancient Prime Archon's confirmation.

"Then we'll proceed with formal review," Viktor announced. "Committee will include representatives from multiple factions, age cohorts, and magical traditions. Target timeline of four weeks for preliminary findings, eight weeks for comprehensive analysis. Acceptable?"

"Acceptable," I confirmed.

"And in the meantime?" Lucian called from the observation section. "Do we continue with current training methods that you're claiming are fundamentally mismatched for younger practitioners?"

"We continue with emotional integration approaches that have been proven effective," I said. "The theory explains why they work, but they're already validated through outcome data. Nothing in my presentation suggests abandoning working methods—it explains why certain methods work better for certain populations and provides framework for developing targeted approaches."

"In other words, no immediate changes pending verification," Viktor clarified.

"Correct. The theory supports existing successful implementations rather than requiring new untested interventions."

That was strategic framing. I was positioning my discovery as explanatory rather than revolutionary—supporting what was already working rather than demanding radical change. It made opposition more difficult because I wasn't asking for immediate action beyond verification.

"Then this session is concluded," Viktor announced. "The Council thanks Elena Sixxx-Darkpurr and the Evolution Coalition for comprehensive presentation. Formal review committee will be established within three days, initial findings expected within four weeks. Proceed accordingly."

The chamber erupted into discussion as people processed implications. I'd just presented theory suggesting fundamental transformation in how supernatural magic operated for younger generation, backed it with comprehensive evidence, and gotten Council agreement for formal verification rather than immediate dismissal.

Political victory, assuming the review committee confirmed my findings.

And assuming Lady Seraphina didn't use the next four weeks to build opposition strong enough to suppress the results regardless of evidence.

---

Lucian found me in the corridor outside the Council chamber as people were filing out.

"That was impressive," he said without preamble. "Comprehensive evidence, historical precedent, strategic framing. You presented revolutionary theory in reformist framework. Very skillful."

"It's not revolutionary if it's true," I replied. "Just explanatory."

"It's both," Lucian countered. "Truth can be revolutionary when it challenges power structures. But you're right that framing it as addition rather than replacement was smart. Harder to oppose 'developing complementary approaches' than 'dismantling hierarchy.' I'm learning a lot watching you operate politically."

"Is that compliment or concern that I'm becoming too politically calculating?"

"Both," Lucian said with slight smile. "You're more effective than I expected at navigating power structures while maintaining integrity. That's valuable. It's also potentially dangerous if you become so focused on political sustainability that you compromise on necessary changes. Balance is difficult."

"Everything about this is difficult," I said. "But I'm trying. Today felt like success—got Council agreement to verify findings rather than immediate dismissal. That's progress."

"It is," Lucian agreed. "And Elena? Thank you. For not suppressing the discovery to avoid political complications. The truth matters, even when—especially when—it's uncomfortable. You demonstrated integrity by presenting evidence fully rather than hiding implications."

"I had people arguing I should wait," I admitted. "Build more support first, reveal incrementally, manage the message. But you can't build evidence-based coalition while strategically suppressing evidence that's politically inconvenient. That's contradiction."

"It is," Lucian said. "And resisting that contradiction is why your coalition is growing while mine is fragmenting. People want leaders who actually believe in stated principles rather than using principles as political tools. You're demonstrating that belief through choices like today's presentation. That's leadership."

"High praise from competing faction leader," I observed.

"Competitors can respect each other's competence," Lucian said. "Actually, competitors should respect each other's competence—makes the competition more productive. I'm watching you succeed through approaches I didn't think would work. That's valuable data about political strategy I need to incorporate. Your success makes me better at my work."

"That's remarkably mature political philosophy."

"I'm learning," Lucian said. "Slowly. Painfully. Through watching you demonstrate that effectiveness doesn't require abandoning principles. You're teaching by example even though you're not trying to teach me anything."

He left, and I stood there processing the interaction. Lucian—radical revolutionary Lucian who'd occupied Council buildings and led protest movements—was learning from my moderate evidence-based approach. And not in hostile way, but genuine appreciation for different method of pursuing similar goals.

Maybe the three-way political balance actually was working. Council providing institutional stability, Lucian's movement providing pressure for change, my coalition providing evidence-based implementation frameworks. Three forces creating productive tension rather than destructive conflict.

Or maybe I was being optimistic and everything would collapse spectacularly once Lady Seraphina mobilized her opposition.

Only one way to find out.

---

The first three weeks of the review committee's analysis were surprisingly productive.

They replicated my studies across different facilities, analyzed historical records I'd cited, and brought in additional experts from various traditions. Every stage of verification supported my findings. The pattern of evolved magic operating through collaborative alignment rather than hierarchical control held across all testing populations. The correlation between age and magical operation mode was consistent. The historical precedent was documented in multiple independent sources.

By week three, the preliminary findings were clear: my theory was correct.

And Lady Seraphina was increasingly desperate to find some way to discredit or suppress the implications.

"The evidence may be sound," she argued during preliminary review presentation, "but the social implications are unacceptable. Suggesting that traditional authority structures are fundamentally incompatible with younger generation's magic is inherently destabilizing. Even if technically accurate, presenting such findings publicly undermines governance legitimacy."

"So you're arguing we should suppress verified truth because it's politically inconvenient?" I challenged.

"I'm arguing that responsible leadership sometimes requires discretion about what information is publicly disseminated and how," Lady Seraphina countered. "The review confirms magical differences exist. That's sufficient for developing improved training methods. Claiming these differences require fundamental governance restructuring is unnecessary extrapolation that serves your political agenda rather than serving the community."

"The governance implications aren't extrapolation—they're logical consequence of the findings," I replied. "If significant population segment manifests magic that operates through collaborative frameworks, maintaining purely hierarchical governance creates inherent tension. That's not political spin—that's structural analysis."

"And implementing 'hybrid governance' that reduces traditional authority is convenient solution that happens to increase your coalition's power," Lady Seraphina said. "You're framing political power grab as evidence-based necessity. That's manipulation disguised as scholarship."

"I'm framing structural incompatibility as problem requiring structural solution," I countered, working to keep frustration from voice. "You're welcome to propose alternative approaches that address the documented mismatch between governance frameworks and population capabilities. But dismissing the problem because you dislike my proposed solutions is irresponsible leadership."

"Proposing revolutionary change based on three weeks of research is irresponsible leadership," Lady Seraphina shot back.

"Proposing adaptation based on three weeks of research verifying thousands of years of historical patterns documented in multiple independent sources," I corrected. "This isn't hastily formed theory—it's explanation for known phenomenon that's been observed repeatedly throughout supernatural history. We're not making radical claims. We're recognizing cyclical pattern and responding appropriately."

"Enough," Viktor interrupted before the argument could escalate further. "The review committee has verified the core findings regarding magical evolution and operational differences between age cohorts. The question of governance implications is separate from verifying the underlying phenomenon. We can acknowledge the magical reality while debating appropriate social responses."

"Agreed," I said immediately. "The magic is evolving. That's confirmed. How we respond socially is legitimate subject for political debate. I'm not claiming my approach is only option—I'm claiming inaction isn't option."

"And what does inaction look like?" Corvinus asked, actually curious rather than hostile.

"Continued increase in wild manifestations as more young people manifest evolved magic without appropriate training frameworks," I explained. "Growing generational tension as incompatibility between magic and governance becomes more pronounced. Eventually, either revolutionary transformation forced by crisis or systematic suppression of evolved magic users to maintain traditional structures. Both outcomes are significantly worse than proactive adaptation."

"That's speculative projection, not verified data," Lady Seraphina challenged.

"It's pattern analysis based on historical precedent," I countered. "Previous cycles that weren't addressed proactively resulted in significant social disruption. Cycles that were addressed through developing complementary frameworks resulted in peaceful integration. The historical data is clear—proactive adaptation produces better outcomes than reactive crisis management."

"The review committee confirms historical pattern exists," Viktor said, reviewing reports. "Previous evolutionary cycles that developed hybrid frameworks integrated successfully. Cycles that attempted to suppress or ignore the evolution resulted in institutional collapse and rebuilding. The evidence supports Elena's projection that proactive response is preferable."

Lady Seraphina clearly wanted to argue further, but she couldn't refute verified historical patterns. The data was comprehensive, the analysis was sound, and the implications were increasingly difficult to dismiss.

"I propose pilot program," I suggested. "Implement hybrid governance frameworks in specific facilities and regions. Monitor outcomes, compare to control locations maintaining traditional structures. If the data supports hybrid approaches producing better outcomes, expand implementation. If not, revise our theories. Evidence-based progression rather than wholesale transformation."

"That's reasonable approach," Viktor acknowledged. "Allows verification of governance theories similarly to how we verified magical theories. We can assess actual outcomes rather than debating hypothetical implications."

"And if the pilot programs fail?" Lady Seraphina demanded.

"Then we've learned something valuable and adjust accordingly," I said simply. "That's how evidence-based reform works—try, measure, adapt. Not every theory survives contact with reality. But refusing to test theories because they might fail guarantees we never improve anything."

"I'll support pilot program proposal," Zephyra said from her position. "Measured implementation with clear evaluation criteria. That's appropriate response to verified phenomenon requiring governance adaptation. We proceed carefully but we do proceed."

"As will I," Corvinus added, somewhat surprisingly. "The evidence is substantial, the historical precedent is clear, and pilot program approach manages risk appropriately. I'm not comfortable with wholesale governance transformation, but I'm willing to test hybrid frameworks in controlled contexts."

That was significant. Corvinus was traditional authority figure, werewolf lord with thousands of years of hierarchical leadership. Him supporting even pilot programs meant moderate Council members were accepting the evidence despite political discomfort.

Lady Seraphina was losing the argument.

"Then we'll proceed with formal proposal for pilot programs," Viktor announced. "Evolution Coalition will develop specific implementation plans, Council will establish evaluation criteria, review committee will monitor outcomes. Target timeline of six months for initial assessment. Acceptable?"

"Acceptable," I confirmed.

Lady Seraphina said nothing, but her expression made clear this wasn't over. She'd lost this battle, but she'd continue fighting the war. The question was whether successful pilot programs would shift enough moderate support to overcome her opposition, or whether she'd find ways to sabotage implementation before it could demonstrate success.

Either way, we were moving forward. Evidence-based reform was actually happening, despite political resistance.

Small victories accumulating into larger transformation.

I found Dad waiting outside the Council chamber after the session concluded.

"That was well played," he said, falling into step beside me as we walked toward the family estate. "You navigated political minefield without burning bridges unnecessarily. Strategic rather than reckless. I'm... impressed."

"You sound surprised," I observed.

"I am," Dad admitted. "When you formed independent coalition, I worried you were charging toward failure by alienating all existing power structures. Instead, you built evidence-based approach that makes opposition look politically motivated rather than principled. That's sophisticated political strategy I didn't think you'd developed yet."

"I learned from watching you," I said. "You reformed supernatural society by being right and being able to prove it. That's the model I'm following—just with different challenges requiring different tactics."

"Different and similar," Dad said. "I had luxury of existential crisis forcing cooperation. You're building cooperation through demonstrated competence. That's harder but potentially more sustainable. I'm... proud. And slightly concerned that I might have created problem for my future self by teaching you too well."

"Problem how?"

"You're going to be formidable Council member eventually," Dad said with slight smile. "Probably more effective than I ever was at navigating complex politics. That's wonderful for supernatural society. Less wonderful for father who occasionally disagrees with daughter's decisions and won't be able to override through superior political skill."

"Are you actually worried about that?"

"A little," Dad admitted. "You're eighteen and already outmaneuvering Council members with centuries of political experience. By the time you're thirty, you'll probably be running circles around all of us. That's exactly what I wanted—child who could build on my work and exceed my capabilities. But parenting doesn't stop just because child becomes politically formidable. Learning to step back while still being available when needed... that's complicated."

"We'll figure it out," I said. "Together. That's what families do."

"Families where daughter isn't already more politically sophisticated than father," Dad said, but he was smiling.

We walked in comfortable silence for a while before Dad spoke again. "What you said about structural incompatibility... that was real insight, not just political framing. You genuinely understand something about magical evolution and social organization that I never considered. That's not just following my model. That's developing your own analytical frameworks."

"I had good teachers," I said. "You, Mom, Zephyra. All of you taught me to look at systems rather than just individuals. This discovery is application of those lessons."

"It's synthesis of those lessons into something new," Dad corrected. "That's different from application. You're not just using tools we gave you—you're creating new tools based on principles we taught. That's when student becomes master. When the teaching transcends into independent innovation."

"I'm nowhere near master level."

"You're further along than you think," Dad said seriously. "And Elena? Don't let political success make you arrogant. Hubris is what destroys effective leaders—thinking success means infallibility. Stay humble, stay open to being wrong, stay willing to learn. That's how you maintain effectiveness across decades rather than burning bright and flaming out."

"Advice from experience?"

"Advice from watching brilliant leaders fail," Dad said. "I've been lucky that my natural paranoia keeps me checking assumptions. But I've seen others—equally talented, equally committed—destroy themselves through certainty they were always right. Don't be one of them."

"I'll try," I promised.

"That's all anyone can do," Dad said. "Try, fail sometimes, learn from failures, keep trying. That's leadership. Not perfection—persistent iteration toward better outcomes."

We reached the estate, and Dad pulled me into embrace. "I'm proud of you," he said quietly. "Not just for the political success, but for maintaining integrity while achieving it. That's the balance I always struggled with. You're managing it better than I did at your age. Better than I do now, honestly."

"Thanks, Dad," I said, meaning it. His approval mattered more than I usually let myself acknowledge.

"Now go celebrate with your coalition," Dad said, releasing me. "You earned victory today. Enjoy it before the next crisis demands attention."

"Do crises ever stop demanding attention?"

"Not in my experience," Dad said with rueful smile. "But you learn to celebrate victories in between. Otherwise it's just endless crisis management with no joy. That's unsustainable even for Balance."

I left him there and found Marcus waiting near the estate entrance.

"Successful day?" he asked.

"Successful day," I confirmed. "Review committee verified findings, Council approved pilot programs, Lady Seraphina lost political battle. Progress."

"Then we celebrate," Marcus decided. "Dinner at that restaurant you like, victory toast with your coalition, then quiet evening reminding each other why we're doing this exhausting work."

"That sounds perfect," I said.

"I thought it might," Marcus replied, offering his arm. "Come on, Elena. Time to enjoy success before the next challenge arrives."

Because there would always be next challenge. That was leadership—endless succession of problems requiring solutions. But today, we'd made progress. Evidence-based reform was happening, magical evolution was being acknowledged and addressed, and the coalition I'd built was proving effective at navigating complex politics.

Small victories accumulating into larger transformation.

That was enough for today.
