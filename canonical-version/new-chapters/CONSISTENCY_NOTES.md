# Raechelle POV Chapters - Consistency Notes

## Hair Color Inconsistency in Main Story

**Issue**: The main Blood-Craft-Canonical.md has an inconsistency regarding Raechelle's hair color:
- **Chapter 2**: "midnight" hair with "subtle blue highlights"
- **Chapter 13**: "crimson" hair
- **Chapter 15**: "amber hair" / "liquid copper"

**Resolution for POV Chapters**: The Raechelle POV chapters avoid specific hair color descriptions to remain neutral on this inconsistency. If the main story is updated to resolve this, the POV chapters can be updated accordingly.

## Age Consistency

**Raechelle's Age**:
- Chapter 2.5 (at time of Riven's awakening): 247 years old ✓
- Chapter 7.5 (10 days later): 247 years old ✓  
- Chapter 15.5 (several months later): Age not specified ✓
- Chapter 29.5 (6 years later): 253 years old ✓

The aging is mathematically consistent across all chapters.

## Eye Color

## Recommendations for Main Story Updates

If updating the main Blood-Craft-Canonical.md for consistency:

1. **Hair Color**: Choose one description (midnight/black OR crimson/amber) and update all references
2. **Crimson Ball Attack**: The attack referenced in Chapter 15.5 should be fully written in the main narrative either:
   - As part of Chapter 15 (before the current opening)
   - As a separate chapter before the current Chapter 15
   - In an earlier chapter with Chapter 15 being pure aftermath

## Character Voice

Raechelle's POV chapters maintain:
- First-person perspective
- Mature, centuries-old wisdom
- Emotional vulnerability despite her age
- Protective instincts toward Riven
- Internal conflict between duty and love
- Feminine perspective on the relationship

All POV chapters are written to complement, not contradict, the existing narrative.
