# Raechelle POV Chapters - Consistency Notes

## Hair Color Inconsistency - ✅ RESOLVED (February 2026)

**Previous Issue**: The main Blood-Craft-Canonical.md had an inconsistency regarding Raechelle's hair color:
- **Chapter 2**: "midnight" hair with "subtle blue highlights"
- **Chapter 13**: "crimson" hair
- **Chapter 15**: "amber hair" / "liquid copper"

**✅ RESOLUTION COMPLETE**: All inconsistencies have been fixed in the main narrative. Raechelle's hair color is now consistently described as **"midnight black"** throughout all 47 chapters. The following corrections were made:
- Line 4979: Changed to "complemented her midnight hair"
- Line 5917: Changed to "midnight hair spilled across the pillow like dark silk"

**POV Chapters**: The Raechelle POV chapters maintain neutral descriptions and are compatible with the canonical "midnight black" hair color.
