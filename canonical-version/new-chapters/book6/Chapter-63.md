**Word Count**: ~7,000 words
**POV**: Elena Sixxx-Darkpurr
**Timeline**: Five years after Book 5 (Elena age 26, Kael age 3)

---

The frosting on Kael's birthday cake is the precise shade of deep crimson that Marcus spent forty minutes debating with the bakery over comm crystal yesterday morning, and I stood in the doorway of the estate's main hall watching my mother arrange the candles with the careful, unhurried precision she brings to everything—the same precision she has presumably brought to everything for two hundred and seventy-eight years—and I thought: *this is what we built it all for*.

Not in a grand, rhetorical sense. Not the way I say it in Council addresses when I need people to understand why cooperative governance matters, why the work of maintaining balance is worth the grinding, thankless years of it. I mean it in the small, specific way of someone standing in afternoon light watching their son refuse to sit still long enough for his grandmother to comb his hair, watching Viktor's enormous hand reaching out to intercept a careening candle that Kael's elbow had knocked sideways, watching my father pretend he isn't keeping a subtle count of every pack member and coven representative present in the room.

He's been doing that all morning. The counting.

I notice it because I inherited the habit. Dad would probably say it isn't habit, it's situational awareness, and there's a difference. Five years of marriage to Marcus and the accumulated weight of leading the Council's Balance oversight committee have blurred that distinction considerably for me. Situational awareness. Habit. At a certain level of practiced threat assessment, the line between them stops meaning very much.

But today I'm making a conscious effort to be here instead of cataloguing angles of approach.

Kael is three years old. He is wearing a shirt with a wolf printed on the chest because Marcus bought it three months ago "just in case," which is Marcus's version of optimism—he acquires things on the assumption that joy will happen and readies himself accordingly. He has my dark hair and Marcus's jaw and eyes that shift between brown and gold depending on his mood in a way that makes the Academy's intake researchers quietly fascinated. He has the ability to find every breakable object in any given room within approximately ninety seconds of entering it, and he has the laugh his grandfather gave him, that surprised, delighted sound like something good caught him off guard.

He is three years old and he is the best thing I have ever helped make.

"Mama." He appeared at my elbow, tugging my sleeve with the focused urgency of someone who has urgent things to communicate. "Mama, Gran Raechelle said I can't eat the candles."

"Gran Raechelle is correct."

"But they're red."

"Many things are red that aren't edible."

He thought about this with the gravity it apparently deserved. "Papa's training pads are red."

"Also not edible."

"Grandpa Riven's—"

"Kael."

"—the red part of his magic—"

"*Still* not edible."

He grinned, which meant he had been testing me rather than genuinely confused about the candle situation. He does this constantly—constructs apparent questions that are actually experiments in seeing how far a proposition can be pushed before it breaks. Marcus calls it scientific method. My mother calls it exactly like his grandfather, which Dad refuses to confirm or deny. I call it exhausting and wonderful in approximately equal proportions.

He was gone again, ricocheting toward where Viktor's two youngest grandchildren had set up some elaborate game with carved wooden figurines in the corner near the fireplace. Viktor watched them from a chair that was almost but not quite large enough for him, arms crossed, looking simultaneously like he could wrestle a mountain and like he would rather die than admit how charmed he was by all of this.

Twenty-five years, Riven and Viktor. A quarter century of alliance and genuine friendship that had outlasted three factional realignments, two near-catastrophes, and one deeply uncomfortable incident involving Viktor's territory and an experimental water working that I was not present for and have been carefully shielded from the specific details of. Viktor had brought his whole immediate family today—his daughter Kira, her husband and their three children, two of his senior pack advisors who had apparently been friends with Riven long enough to count as extended family by sheer tenure.

I watched Marcus cross the room to say something to Viktor, and Viktor's expression shifted into the particular approximation of a smile that he reserved for people he trusted, and I thought: *this is it. This is the thing we were protecting*.

The supernatural world five years on from the Evolution Accords looked like this. It looked like a werewolf alpha at a vampire-witch-blood-archon family's gathering, sitting in the too-small chair, watching children play. It looked like Corvinus—ancient and precise and still occasionally unnerving in ways I've learned to categorize as aesthetic rather than threatening—discussing something with Lady Seraphina in the corner with the careful courtesy of two people who have spent the better part of a century learning to be allies instead of adversaries. It looked like Morgana running late because her research fellowship had a presentation this morning and she'd commed three times apologizing and once to ask if there was still cake, which there was.

It looked like my parents.

Corvinus caught my eye across the room and inclined his head in the particular way that means *I acknowledge that this moment is significant*. He has been doing that for eleven years—the careful acknowledgment, the precise recognition. He was my father's mentor before he was my ally, and somewhere in the architecture of that precedence relationship lives a complicated regard for me that I have spent considerable time mapping. He respects me because I have earned it. He cares about the family because Riven has made it impossible not to. He comes to Kael's birthday parties because he has, somewhere in his several centuries of careful precision, developed genuine affection for a three-year-old who has no interest whatsoever in being overawed by ancient vampires.

Last month Kael had climbed into Corvinus's lap without asking. Corvinus had gone very still in the way of an immortal who is recalibrating rapidly, and then he had placed one careful hand on Kael's back in the way you place a hand on something precious that has surprised you with its weight, and they had both looked at the picture book Kael was already in the middle of explaining, and that was that. Corvinus had listened to a twenty-minute exposition on magical flora classifications from a three-year-old with the focused attention he would have given a Council briefing.

Lady Seraphina had watched that scene and said, quietly, to no one in particular: "He has never done that before."

She would know. Eight years of alliance, and before that, years of adversarial proximity in which she had studied everyone in this family the way you study opposition: comprehensively, with the understanding that detail is protection. She had come to Kael's first birthday party with a present she had clearly spent considerable time selecting—a set of carved wooden animal figures, each one precise and beautiful, each one representing a different supernatural community. Kael had immediately used them to construct an elaborate scenario involving a dragon (which she had not included, because dragons were not in the present taxonomy and she was precise about things like that, and he had simply called the fire-affinity figure a dragon and she had not corrected him, which I noted as evidence of genuine fondness).

We had all, one way or another, been claimed by this child.

Mom had finished with the candles. She stood back from the table with that slight tilt to her head that means she's assessing and adjusting—she's been doing it for 278 years and she has never entirely learned to just leave things as they are, though I think she's come to terms with that tendency as being part of who she is rather than a flaw to correct. She caught my eye across the room and gave me the small smile that means *your son is wonderful and I am deeply smug about it*, and I gave her back the smile that means *yes and it is entirely your fault*.

Dad was near the window.

He had one hand in his jacket pocket and his weight shifted slightly forward on his feet—not tense, exactly, more like someone who has never entirely stopped expecting something to happen, even in the middle of the good days. At forty-six he wore his years the way the estate's old stone walls wore theirs: with density and character and the occasional hint that things were going on beneath the surface that the surface wasn't fully communicating. His hair had gone mostly silver over the last five years. He'd grown into the gray gradually enough that I'd barely tracked its progress, and then one morning I'd looked at a photograph from Kael's first birthday and thought: *when did that happen*.

He was watching Kael.

The expression on my father's face when he watches his grandson is something I don't have precise language for. I've tried. It's not simply love, though love is obviously present. It's something more geological—the way a landscape looks when you understand that it has been shaped by forces that were working for a very long time before the current terrain emerged. Dad has spent his entire adult life being the thing that stands between other people and harm. He has paid costs for that. He carries those costs the way he carries everything: quietly, without elaboration, occasionally surfacing in the small lines around his eyes or the particular quality of his silences.

When he looks at Kael, I think he sees something that made the costs worth calculating.

I was still in the doorway doing all of this unnecessary observation when Morgana finally arrived in a burst of kinetic energy and the faint smell of potions-lab that follows her everywhere she goes, thrusting a wrapped present at me and kissing my cheek and immediately disappearing toward the refreshments table with the focus of someone who had not eaten since morning. Which, knowing Morgana's presentation schedule, she probably hadn't.

"Elena." She surfaced momentarily from her assessment of the food. "Your child is extremely tall."

"He's three. They grow."

"He's very—" She paused, tracking Kael across the room with the instinctive research attention she brings to anything that strikes her as noteworthy. "He's doing something interesting with his hands."

I looked.

Kael was crouched near the wooden figurines, showing Viktor's granddaughter something, his brow furrowed in concentration. He had both hands cupped slightly, palms up, and there was—

I blinked.

There was a small, contained sphere of something hovering just above his palms.

I had seen Kael do blood magic before. First signs at eighteen months, which was early but not, given his parentage, entirely shocking—a faint crimson luminescence when he was upset or excited, the kind of ambient resonance that young blood-affinities sometimes produce before they have any conscious control. Marcus and I had quietly flagged it with Dr. Vasquez at the Academy's developmental program and been told to let it develop naturally, monitor for distress indicators, bring him in at two for initial assessment.

The initial assessment had been interesting. That was the exact word Dr. Vasquez had used. *Interesting*.

But this was not the faint crimson resonance. This was not ambient bleed-through from uncontrolled emotional output.

The sphere above my son's cupped hands was three colors.

Crimson. The deep blood-magic red I recognized from my own early workings and from my father's. That was familiar.

Golden. Fire-affinity warm and bright as a struck match, but contained, shaped, not burning anything or anyone.

And blue. Clear and cool and distinctly, unmistakably water-affinity.

All three. Simultaneously. One small sphere, three entirely separate affinities, woven together by a three-year-old who was trying to show his new friend something pretty.

I felt the air in the room change.

Not atmospheric. Not physical. I felt it in the way I've learned to feel things that happen in the register of magical attention—the slight sharpening, the collective inhale that people don't always consciously take but that happens nonetheless when something fundamentally unexpected occurs.

Viktor's granddaughter clapped her hands in delight. "Pretty!" she said, because she was four and had not yet learned to distinguish between *pretty* and *impossible*.

Kael beamed and let the sphere dissolve.

I was already looking at my father.

He had gone very still.

That specific quality of stillness—I've seen it before, but rarely. It's the stillness he goes into when something requires absolute internal attention, when his mind is doing the kind of rapid, layered calculation that he normally keeps invisible. He was standing with his hand still in his jacket pocket and he was looking at Kael with an expression that contained no readable emotion because he was keeping it out of his face with what I recognized as deliberate effort.

Beside him—and I hadn't noticed her arrive, which tells you something about how distracted I was—Zephyra stood. She had been in conversation with Corvinus near the window. She was no longer in conversation with anyone. She was standing at my father's shoulder with 3,000 years of accumulated perception focused in the same direction his was.

They exchanged a look.

I know my father's face. I have been studying Riven Sixxx's expressions since I was old enough to understand that his face was a primary text I should be reading carefully, because the things he doesn't say are often more informative than the things he does. I know the look he gives Mom when something concerns him but he doesn't want to alarm anyone. I know the look he gives me when he's proud and doesn't quite know how to say it. I know the look he has when he's fighting something and when he's calculating and when he's decided.

I did not fully know the look he exchanged with Zephyra in that moment. But I recognized its category.

It was the look of someone who has just seen something that confirms a fear they were hoping was wrong.

---

Marcus appeared at my side before I'd finished making sense of what I'd just seen.

He had been watching from across the room—I knew from the angle he was coming from that he'd seen it too, and that his response had been identical to mine: the pause, the very careful recalibration. He stood beside me and we both looked at the space where Kael had been crouching, now occupied only by Viktor's granddaughter still looking pleased about the pretty light.

"That was three," Marcus said, quietly, in the tone we use for things we're processing while still attending to other things.

"Yes."

"Simultaneously."

"Yes."

He was quiet for a moment. "He's three years old."

"I'm aware."

Marcus looked at me—the look that contains the acknowledgment that we are both thinking the same thing and that the thing we are both thinking is significant and that we are choosing, for now, to let the party continue. "Should we—"

"Not yet," I said. "Let me see what Dad and Zephyra do."

We watched them without watching them—the practiced surveillance of people who've spent years monitoring situations without appearing to monitor them. Both of them had gone still. Both of them were doing the recalibration I recognized. And then, with the kind of silence that only exists between people who have known each other long enough to use it fluently, they communicated something.

Whatever it was, it ended with Zephyra beginning an unhurried circuit of the room that would take her, eventually, to the doorway to the east corridor. Dad moved toward Kael. Not urgently—nothing about his movement suggested urgency, and he was too skilled a practitioner and too experienced a protector to signal alarm to a room full of sharp-sensed supernatural beings. He crouched beside Kael and Viktor's granddaughter and asked about the wooden figurines in the tone of a grandfather doing exactly what a grandfather at a birthday party should be doing.

But his right hand, the one not visible to the room, made a very small gesture.

I knew that gesture. I had last seen it during the aftermath of the Coalition Negotiations, when we were in a room with four factions whose alliance was still fragile enough that a wrong inflection could crack it. It meant: *not here, not now, but soon*.

"I need to follow them," I said to Marcus.

"I know," he said. "Go. I'll keep things running."

This is what five years of marriage to a security professional looks like: he sees the situation, he assesses his role in it, he fills that role without needing to negotiate who does what or how. He would keep the party functioning, keep Viktor's family comfortable, manage whatever needed managing while I went to find out what my father and Zephyra were seeing that I hadn't yet seen.

---

The party continued.

That's the thing about being the people we are—you learn to continue the party. You learn to keep your face appropriately warm and present and celebratory while the back of your mind does the calculation you don't want it to do. Marcus brought out the cake. Kael was delighted by his name written in red frosting and immediately tried to eat said name before the candles were lit. Viktor's grandchildren screamed encouragement. Morgana got frosting on her sleeve and didn't notice. My mother took photographs with the small silver device she'd acquired two years ago and learned to use with the dedication she brings to mastering anything she decides is worth her attention.

I sang *happy birthday* to my son and I watched my father and Zephyra have three separate conversations in the spaces between toasts and laughter and the chaos of present-opening, and every one of those conversations lasted exactly long enough to communicate something specific and contained, and every one of them ended with both of them returning to the social field with the same careful careful expressions.

After the presents. After the cake. After Viktor's grandchildren needed to be extracted from underneath the table where they had constructed some kind of fort using the wrapping paper. After Kael had been transferred to my mother's arms in the boneless, absolute way of a three-year-old who has decided that sleep is happening regardless of venue or circumstance.

Dad appeared at my elbow.

"Walk with me," he said. Not a question.

"Outside?"

"The lower study."

I looked at him. He met my eyes, and I understood that whatever careful calibration he'd been maintaining since Kael's sphere had officially ended.

I found Marcus first. He was in the main hall helping Corvinus and Seraphina organize the departure of the older attendees, and when he looked at my face he straightened slightly in the way that means he's shifting from social to alert. I tilted my head toward the corridor. He nodded, understanding without words the way we've learned to communicate in five years of marriage—in looks and small movements that carry a lot of information.

He would keep things running. I would go see what my father needed to show me.

---

The lower study is in the east wing, below grade, and it has the particular stillness of rooms that have absorbed a lot of serious conversation over the years. Riven's books line three walls. The fourth is a set of heavy curtains that cover a working space, cleared of furniture, where large-scale magic can be done without risk to the room's contents or its occupants.

Zephyra was already there when we arrived. She had lit the study lamps but left the curtains open on the working space, and she was standing in the center of it looking at something that wasn't physically present—looking, I realized, at a monitoring construct. A thread of silver-white air-affinity energy spooled out from her outstretched hand, delicate as spider silk and considerably more sophisticated than anything I could produce in air-working, reaching toward something I couldn't see with my eyes.

"What are you monitoring?" I asked.

"The perimeter." Riven said it from behind me. He had closed the study door. "Not this perimeter. The other one."

I knew which other one he meant. There was only one other perimeter that required Zephyra's 3,000-year-old monitoring constructs and my father's careful face.

The seal.

The containment they'd built eight years ago around the entity that had nearly consumed everything. The solution they'd constructed at extraordinary cost when destroying the Devourer outright had proven beyond any of our combined capabilities—seal it, contain it, hold it in place and hope the seal's longevity exceeded everyone currently living.

"Show me," I said.

Zephyra didn't turn. She adjusted the monitoring construct, and the silver-white thread thickened, and then I could see it—not the physical location, which was a dimensional nexus point that had no geographic correlate in the ordinary world, but the seal itself, its shape and density and current state, overlaid in Zephyra's precise air-affinity visualization like a map of something that only exists in the register where affinities operate.

Eight years ago it had been brilliant and complex and deeply layered, with redundancies built into redundancies, with the combined workings of every Prime Archon present woven through its core architecture. I had been at the sealing. I had been twenty years old and contributing everything I had while my father stood at the center of it and poured himself into the structure with the focused certainty of someone who has decided this is what he's for.

The seal I was looking at now was not what it had been.

It was degrading. Not catastrophically—not the way something looks when it's been actively attacked or destabilized. More like erosion. The way a coastline looks when water has been working at it for years: the shape still recognizable, the structure fundamentally intact, but thinner here, collapsed there, layers peeling away from the interior in ways that were gradual until they weren't.

"This is—" I stopped. Made myself look at it properly instead of reacting to it. "This rate of degradation. Zephyra, when was the last time you checked?"

"Fourteen days ago." Her voice was completely level. After 3,000 years, I imagine you learn to keep your voice level. "This deterioration has occurred in fourteen days."

"The expected deterioration for fourteen days would be—"

"Less than one tenth of what I'm observing." She withdrew the monitoring construct, coiling it back into herself with the economy of a practitioner who has never in her life spent more energy than a working requires. "The rate has accelerated. Substantially."

I looked at my father. "How long?"

"We don't know with precision." He said it the way he says things he doesn't want to be true—flatly, with no editorial decoration. "The degradation pattern is inconsistent. Some structural elements are holding better than others. But Zephyra's models—"

"Thirty days," Zephyra said. "Possibly less. Unlikely more."

Thirty days.

I sat down.

I did not mean to sit down. There was no chair in my immediate vicinity; I sat on the edge of Riven's reading desk, which is solid oak and has presumably survived worse than me sitting on it abruptly. I stared at the empty working space for a moment and did the thing I do when I need to think through something that my instincts want to run from: I itemized it.

*The seal on the Devourer is degrading. The timeline is thirty days. We expected years. We had not prepared for thirty days.* I felt the weight of that land in my chest and sat with it for the count of three breaths, which is what I give myself for the initial reaction before I have to move back into analysis. *Thirty days. What do we do with thirty days.*

"That's not everything," I said. Because I knew my father's careful face, and the careful face was still on.

He looked at Zephyra. She looked at him. Some silent consensus.

"The Devourer absorbed partial Prime Archon essence during the last engagement," Zephyra said. "We knew this. We knew it took something from Riven during the sealing—the cost he paid was not merely exhaustion."

"I remember." Dad had spent six weeks recovering from the sealing. Six weeks during which he had been very carefully fine and nobody had believed him.

"What we did not know, because we lacked the monitoring sophistication to detect it—" Zephyra paused, and in 3,000 years of pauses, that one contained something she was choosing how to word very carefully. "The essence it absorbed did not simply drain away. It was incorporated. The Devourer has been using it."

I felt something cold move through me that had nothing to do with temperature.

"Using it how?" I asked, though I was already starting to understand from the way she'd looked at Dad when Kael was demonstrating his impossible three-affinity sphere, from the way my father had gone still the moment he'd seen it.

"Prime Archon essence has a signature," Zephyra said. "Each of us has one—unique, specific, recognizable to anyone with the sensitivity to detect it. Like a scent, in a way. Or a frequency. The Devourer has learned to recognize that frequency." She met my eyes. "It has developed the ability to locate Prime Archon essence signatures across reality. To track them. To move toward them specifically."

"It can hunt us."

"Yes."

I thought about Kael's sphere. Crimson and gold and blue, all at once, held aloft by tiny three-year-old hands. That sphere had a signature. That sphere was the most visible possible announcement that a fourth Prime Archon had just manifested abilities in that room.

"Kael," I said.

"Yes." Dad's voice. Very quiet.

"He set off a—when he did the three-affinity working. That would have been—"

"Beacon is perhaps too strong a word," Zephyra said. "At his level of development, the signature is faint. Unfocused. He doesn't know he's broadcasting, so there's no discipline applied to suppression. But yes. When he manifests multiple affinities simultaneously, it is detectable." A pause. "The Devourer, through the weakening seal, would have detected it."

The cold thing in my chest expanded.

I have trained for many things over the past decade. I have trained in combat magic and diplomatic frameworks and crisis management and the specific, brutal kind of strategic thinking that doesn't allow for emotional responses until after the immediate threat is neutralized. I have stood in Council chambers while people tried to destabilize everything I'd worked to build and I have kept my voice level and my arguments precise and my hands from shaking through sheer accumulated practice.

I was having significant difficulty keeping my hands from shaking right now.

"He's three years old," I said.

"Elena." Dad moved toward me. I held up one hand.

"I know. I know, I understand the full picture, I'm processing it." I needed a moment. I took the moment. I set aside the part of my brain that was already imagining Kael with shadows closing in, the part that had been a mother for three years and could conjure in precise and terrible detail exactly what existential threat to a three-year-old looked like, and I set it aside deliberately and found the analytical layer that exists underneath. "All right. We need to understand the scope. Who is targeted. Whether the Devourer has already begun acting on the targeting capability or whether the seal is still constraining it enough that it's sensing but not moving."

"The latter, currently." Zephyra had a small silver monitoring device—one of her own design, centuries old and still functioning—that she drew from her inner pocket. "The seal constrains its movement even as it degrades. For now, it can sense. It cannot yet reach."

"For now."

"For now."

I thought about the four of us. Dad. Zephyra. Me. Kael. Four Prime Archon signatures in the world, and the only thing with both the motivation and the capability to specifically hunt them across reality was sitting behind a thirty-day seal.

"We need to call the Council," I said.

"Elena—" My father, gentle.

"I know they can't solve it. But they need to know. The supernatural world governance structure cannot plan appropriately if its leadership is walking into an emergency blind." I looked at him. "You know I'm right."

He did know. He exhaled—the specific exhale of someone who agrees with a position they were going to argue against on protective instinct. "Yes. You're right."

"And we need to know what resources we have. Research, precedent, anyone who's worked on Devourer containment theory since the sealing." I was standing now, moving toward his bookshelf without entirely planning to, running my fingers along the spines the way I used to do as a child when thinking problems through. "And we need to talk about Kael. Specifically about his signature and whether there's a way to dampen it before—"

"Before the seal degrades further," Zephyra finished. "Yes. That is the most immediate priority. He cannot continue to manifest openly."

"He's three. You can't explain 'don't use your magic' to a three-year-old whose magic is connected to his emotional state."

"No." Zephyra's voice held something that might, in a practitioner with fewer years, have been mistaken for uncertainty. "No, you cannot."

My father had not said anything for the last several exchanges. I turned to look at him and found the expression I hadn't seen in a long time—the one he gets when the thing he's protecting people from and the people he's protecting are in the same conversation and there's no version of the explanation that doesn't hurt. He'd worn it when I was sixteen and learning what his past had actually looked like. He'd worn it during the Devourer crisis eight years ago when he'd sat across from me and told me the true cost of the sealing.

He wore it now.

"Dad." My voice came out steadier than I expected. "We're going to handle this."

"I know." He said it with conviction. I believed that he believed it. I also knew my father well enough to know that *handling* something and *everyone emerging unscathed* were two different promises and he was careful never to conflate them.

"Thirty days is time," I said. "It's not nothing. We have thirty days, and we have three Prime Archons, and we have the full resources of the consolidated supernatural governance structure, and we are going to use all of it."

"Elena's Balance applied to existential threat," Zephyra said. It might have been dry. With Zephyra, it was sometimes difficult to distinguish between dryness and ancient precision. "Acknowledge the facts without letting them determine the outcome in advance."

"That's the idea."

I straightened. Pulled my diplomatic posture on the way you pull a coat on—it doesn't change you but it does give you something to inhabit while you're feeling less than poised. Thought about Kael asleep in Mom's arms in the main hall above us, completely unaware that his moment of birthday-party magic had just registered on an ancient cosmic horror's new targeting system.

And then I thought about the broader calculation—what it meant for the supernatural world that all four of its Prime Archons were suddenly potential targets. Riven had spent twenty-six years building the cooperative governance framework. Zephyra had served for three thousand as the living record. I had spent five years building on Riven's foundation. And Kael was three years old and already the most significant magical development in a generation.

Elena's Balance says: hold multiple truths simultaneously. I was terrified for my child. I was also the Voice of Balance. Both things were real. Both required a response.

"We should go back upstairs," I said. "Say goodbye to the guests. Let my mother believe today was what it was supposed to be for as long as possible." I met my father's eyes. "We tell her tonight. And Marcus. And then tomorrow, we call the Council."

Dad nodded. "Tonight."

"All right." I turned to the door and then stopped, because there was one more thing, the thing I'd been holding at arm's length since the numbers had landed. "Thirty days, Zephyra. That's—how certain is that estimate?"

She looked at me with 3,000 years of witnessed catastrophe in her gray eyes and said: "I could be wrong. It may be twenty-five. I do not think it is more than thirty."

I nodded and opened the door and climbed the stairs back toward the sound of my son's party.

---

The guests left gradually, the way good gatherings end—reluctantly, with extended goodbyes and promises for follow-up, Viktor clapping Riven's shoulder with the particular force of a man who considers physical impact to be a form of affection, Corvinus inclining his head to me with the subtle acknowledgment of someone who reads rooms with preternatural precision and has understood that something has shifted but is extending the courtesy of not asking about it. Morgana hugged me and said Kael's three-affinity working had given her seventeen new research questions and could she schedule time with him next week, which under the circumstances produced an emotion I did not entirely have vocabulary for.

"We'll see," I told her.

She looked at my face more carefully than she'd been looking at the frosting situation. "Elena."

"Not tonight," I said. "I'll comm you tomorrow."

She held my gaze for a moment—she is not incapable of reading rooms, Morgana, she just typically prefers to read data—and then she nodded, and I watched her go, and I thought about how tomorrow I was going to have to tell her exactly how many of her seventeen research questions might have to wait.

Marcus found me when the hall had mostly emptied, Kael transferred to his bed with Mom watching over him, Dad and Zephyra in quiet conversation near the fireplace. Marcus read me the way he always reads me—with attention and patience and the particular skill he's developed over five years of being in close partnership with someone who processes things internally before she brings them out.

"The study meeting," he said quietly.

"Yes."

"Bad?"

I looked at my husband—at the steadiness of him, the solid, reliable quality that had nothing to do with invulnerability and everything to do with the kind of person who simply does not abandon his post when things become difficult. He had a smear of red frosting on his collar that I had not yet mentioned. I reached up and touched his face instead.

"I need to tell you something," I said. "And Mom. And then tomorrow, the Council."

He covered my hand with his. His hand is large and warm and has a small scar on the index finger from a training accident four years ago that I know the story of in its entirety because he told me about it on our second anniversary, and I do not know why that is the detail I'm thinking of right now except that specific, particular love of someone has a texture made entirely of those small knowable facts.

"Whatever it is," he said, "we handle it."

He sounded so certain. He had no idea yet what *it* was, and he sounded completely certain.

I love him so much it sometimes feels like a separate organ, one I didn't have before and now cannot imagine the architecture of myself without.

"I know," I said. "Come sit with me."

---

The family meeting lasted two hours. The first portion was me laying out what Zephyra's monitoring had shown, what the thirty-day estimate meant, what the Devourer's new targeting capability implied for everyone in this room. The second portion was responses: Mom's careful stillness that meant she was doing violent things to her own fear in the privacy of her own mind and would not let any of it into the room until she was ready. Marcus going quiet in the way that isn't passivity but concentration, the combat-trained part of his brain shifting into assessment mode. Zephyra providing clarifications with the patient precision of someone who has explained complex situations to panicking people before and has learned that precision is more useful than reassurance in such moments.

Kael slept through all of it. He would sleep through all of it for a little while longer, and I was grateful for that.

Mom spoke first, when the initial presentation was finished. She did not ask whether the data was reliable—she knew Zephyra's monitoring capabilities and she knew that this was not a mistake that would have survived Zephyra's verification process. Instead she asked: "What does Kael's signature exposure mean in practical terms? How specific is its location resolution currently?"

"At current seal degradation levels, resolution is regional," Zephyra said. "It knows roughly where he is. As the seal continues to degrade, resolution will improve. Within two weeks, if degradation continues at current rate, it will have sufficient resolution to target his specific location."

"Two weeks," Mom said. Not a question. Filing it.

"Approximately."

"And the attacks—the probing incursions—would those begin before or after resolution improves?"

"The probing would begin as soon as the Devourer has confidence in a target's location," I said. "Which means we should assume—" I looked at Zephyra. "When would probing become likely?"

"Within a week," she said. "Perhaps sooner if the degradation accelerates beyond current projections."

Mom absorbed this. She folded her hands in her lap—not a gesture of acceptance, a gesture of organizing what comes next. In 278 years she has learned how to hold fear with precisely enough pressure that it doesn't collapse her and doesn't escape into the room, and I have always marveled at that and never quite been able to fully replicate it. I manage fear differently; I move it into analysis, which is slightly less elegant but functionally similar.

"The Academy," Marcus said. "If Kael can't suppress his signature, if his manifestations are detectable—he can't be in a room with forty other young practitioners all doing active workings. The ambient resonance alone—"

"Would mask him somewhat," Zephyra said. "But yes. His attendance should be limited while we determine next steps."

"There's a Council emergency session," I said. "I'll convene it tomorrow morning. We need everyone who worked on the original sealing, everyone who has done theoretical research on Devourer-class entities, all of it on the table."

"And in the meantime," Dad said. He had barely spoken during the meeting. He'd listened and let me lead it—I noticed that, the choice he'd made to follow my lead in the setting of my family home with my family, the trust embedded in that gesture—and now he said the thing we'd all been building toward. "In the meantime. Thirty days is not much time. We need to know if there is a permanent solution. Not containment. Something that ends this."

Silence.

"The sealing was always temporary," Zephyra said. "The entity cannot be destroyed by conventional means. We knew this. We sealed it because destroying it was beyond our collective capability at the time."

"And now?" Mom asked. Her voice was even and her eyes were focused on Zephyra with the intensity of someone who has 278 years of hard-won knowledge behind every question she asks.

"There are older theories." Zephyra folded her hands in her lap with the careful deliberateness of someone deciding how much to say. "Texts I have not accessed in several centuries. An archive beneath the original Sanctum—the first stronghold. I should go. Retrieve what's there. The original researchers, the ones who first encountered entities of this type, may have theorized solutions that we dismissed as unnecessary at the time of the sealing." A pause. "I will go in the morning."

"I'll go with you," Dad said immediately.

Zephyra looked at him. "Yes," she said. "I thought you might."

The thing in her voice when she said it—the particular softness that she usually doesn't let out, that she's been learning to let out more in recent years—I filed it away. There was something in it I wanted to think about more carefully when I had space to think.

Tonight, though. Tonight was running out of space for careful thinking.

"We reconvene tomorrow afternoon," I said. "Council session in the morning, then we wait for Zephyra's findings. Everyone maintains normal patterns until we know more—the last thing we want is to signal panic to the broader community before we have information to provide." I looked around the room at the people I love most in the world. "Questions?"

Silence. Not the silence of people with nothing to say; the silence of people with too much.

"All right." I stood. "Get some sleep. Whatever comes, we start tomorrow."

Marcus took my hand as the meeting broke up, and he held it through the rest of the night. Kael slept in the next room, impossibly small and impossibly powerful and impossibly mine, breathing the even breath of a three-year-old who has had cake and presents and does not yet know that something very old and very terrible has just learned his name.

I lay awake and ran the numbers and tried to find the thirty days that would be enough.

Outside, the spring night was full of stars, and somewhere beyond the reach of ordinary perception, behind a seal that was counting down, something vast and very patient was learning to find us.

## Chapter Notes

**Key Events:**
- Kael's third birthday party establishes the thriving post-Accords supernatural world
- Kael manifests three magical affinities simultaneously (blood/crimson, fire/golden, water/blue)—impossible for any child, let alone a three-year-old
- Riven and Zephyra secretly investigate the Devourer's seal and discover thirty-day degradation timeline
- Zephyra reveals the Devourer has developed the ability to specifically target Prime Archon essence signatures
- All four Prime Archons (Riven, Zephyra, Elena, Kael) are now potential targets
- Emergency family meeting; Council session scheduled for the morning
- Zephyra announces she will access the ancient Sanctum archive seeking permanent solutions

**Character Development:**
- Elena at 26 is a fully realized leader—analytical, warm, competent—but the threat to Kael immediately reveals the limit where analytical calm breaks down
- Marcus shown as a steady, perceptive partner who follows Elena's lead in the family meeting
- Riven shown as protective but intentionally deferring leadership to Elena in this setting
- Zephyra carrying something in her reactions that Elena notices but cannot yet fully read
- Kael established as genuinely impossible—three affinities at three years old suggests fourth Prime Archon

**Continuity Notes:**
- Timeline: five years after Book 5 epilogue, Elena now 26, Marcus 30, Kael 3
- Viktor remains close family friend, now with grandchildren
- Corvinus and Seraphina now reliably allied, enough to attend family events
- Morgana continues research work; interested in Kael's abilities
- The Devourer sealing from Book 4 is now eight years ago; it absorbed partial Riven essence during that event
- Elena's Balance philosophy explicitly referenced as her operational framework
- Book 6 Act One conflict fully established: 30-day countdown, four Prime Archon targets, need for permanent solution
