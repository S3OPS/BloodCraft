# Chapter 67: United Front

**Word Count**: ~7,800 words
**POV**: Riven Sixxx (first-person)
**Timeline**: Day 10 of 30 (approximately 20 days remain until seal failure)

---

The underground training hall smelled of stone and old wards—centuries of intention layered so deep into the bedrock that the air itself carried weight. I'd reinforced those wards twice since we'd consolidated at the estate: once in the first week when the Devourer's intrusions through the weakening seal had started spiking in frequency, and again three nights ago when one of those intrusions had burned through a perimeter sensor array that should have held for a decade. The chamber floor still bore the faint scorch marks from that test. I hadn't ordered them cleaned up. We needed reminders.

Twenty days. Twenty days before the seal Zephyra and I had spent the better part of three years reinforcing simply... stopped. Before the evolved Devourer, the one that had used five years of enforced containment to sharpen itself specifically toward hunting Prime Archons, came through whatever remained.

Twenty days to learn something that had never been successfully done.

I settled into my point of the chalked triangle and tried to breathe properly.

Morgana had marked the configuration herself, the night before, with chalk infused with powdered moon-iron so it would persist against the ambient magic in the chamber rather than blurring. An equilateral triangle, each side measuring exactly twelve feet, each vertex positioned to distribute the working load as evenly as possible. She'd calculated it six different ways—I'd watched her erase and redraw twice—before she'd stood up, satisfied, and told us the geometry was as good as it was going to get.

Zephyra stood at her vertex on the far side of the triangle. She was not moving. She had been not moving for approximately the last four minutes, which was how she prepared—absolute stillness, the kind that suggested she had practiced patience for so long that it had become structural. The silver-white coil of her Air affinity wrapped around her like smoke finding its shape, present and contained. Three thousand years of technique, and it still looked effortless.

Elena sat cross-legged at her point, twelve feet to my left. Her eyes were closed. The slight furrow between her brows told me she wasn't meditating—she was analyzing, running projections the way she ran policy calculations: systematically, with the part of her mind that didn't know how to stop working even when the rest of her was nominally at rest. It was, I had noted across years of watching her develop, one of the most reliable things about her. Also occasionally the most frustrating. She had her notebook open on the stone beside her hip, though she wasn't writing in it yet.

"Now?" she said, without opening her eyes.

"Now," I said.

I reached outward with my awareness the way I'd been doing for twenty-five years—the slow expansion of all five affinities, a net cast across a room. Blood pulsed in the walls where I'd woven it into the ward structure. Fire banked low and steady beneath my sternum, ready but not yet moving. Water pulled at the underground channels I could feel through forty feet of bedrock below our feet, and Earth settled through the stone and down through the foundation in long patient roots that touched soil a hundred yards in any direction. Air traced every current in the sealed chamber, the micro-circulations that followed heat gradients and the slow exhalations of three people trying not to hold their breath.

Five things, held simultaneously. My whole working life.

I reached toward Elena.

And immediately understood why Morgana had said this would be hard.

---

Elena's working style hit me like walking into a different language mid-sentence.

I had watched my daughter develop her craft for over two decades, had sparred with her and trained alongside her and reviewed her more innovative approaches when she brought them to the Council's attention, and I thought I understood how she worked. I understood it the way you understand a language you've learned to read but have never spoken aloud: technically accurate, missing the embodied texture of actually being inside it.

What I encountered when our awareness met in the space between our vertices was not the elegant theory I'd reviewed in her working papers. It was something alive and dynamic and structurally unlike anything I'd been trained to do. She wove her affinities—that was the only word for it. Each thread of power kept distinct from the others but interlocked in a pattern that should, by any classical analysis of magical theory, have been catastrophically unstable. Water and Air braided together in a feedback loop that amplified both. Fire and Earth in a complementary tension that held them at maximum extension without either burning through the other. Blood threaded through everything like a nervous system, the connective tissue of a working that was somehow holding its own shape through sheer mathematical logic.

It was extraordinary.

It was also completely incompatible with what I was doing.

My approach—I had been told this by Corvinus, by Morgana, by two different Council scholars who'd observed training sessions, and once memorably by Elena herself when she was twenty-two and had not yet learned to soften professional critique with family warmth—was like watching someone surf a rip current. I didn't construct. I adapted. Five forces in constant dynamic equilibrium, adjusting in real time to conditions, yielding and redirecting and recalibrating in the way that had kept me alive through two decades of threats that would have killed anyone working from a fixed structure. It had always been my advantage: I didn't have a working that could be anticipated or disrupted, because there wasn't a fixed working to disrupt.

What I did and what Elena did were trying to synchronize the way you'd try to mesh gears running at different speeds. Something was going to grind, or slip, or—

Zephyra reached in from the third vertex.

Everything shattered.

It wasn't violent. No backlash, no explosion, no power surging out of control. It was simply the sudden absence of connection—as though someone had lifted the needle off the record in the same moment that three separate records had all been playing at once. One moment we were reaching toward something theoretical and unified. The next we were each enclosed in our own power again, separate, the space between us empty of anything but air.

Silence.

"Well," Elena said. She opened her eyes. She picked up her pen. She did not look disappointed exactly, but there was a particular quality to the set of her jaw that I recognized as the expression she wore when a result had confirmed a prediction she'd been hoping was wrong. "That was approximately what the models suggested for a first attempt."

"Your models predicted failure?" Zephyra asked. She asked it with genuine curiosity, not challenge.

"The models predicted initial incompatibility." Elena uncurled from cross-legged and rose smoothly—Raechelle's poise, absorbed through proximity over two decades. "First-attempt synchronized working between three Prime Archons with distinct foundational training frameworks has approximately zero percent documented success rate. We're exactly where I expected us to be." She opened her notebook. "Tell me your impressions. I'll start with the incompatibility and work backward to possible solutions."

I told her what I'd felt. The gearing problem. The structural mismatch between her architectural weave and my dynamic equilibrium—two things that both worked brilliantly in isolation and combined with all the grace of two rivers flowing into each other from opposite directions. She wrote while I talked. Zephyra listened, and when I finished, she offered her own assessment in the careful, measured way she had, as though she was translating something from a language with no modern vocabulary.

"My technique predates most contemporary refinements," she said. "By several centuries, in most cases." She had, I knew, overheard Elena describe her working style to Morgana as *a hammer*—had heard it through a wall, two evenings ago, during a research session I hadn't been present for. Something in the steadiness of her expression suggested she found the description accurate rather than insulting. "What you're calling a hammer is the appropriate instrument for the work I've been doing for three millennia. Large-scale force. Broad architecture. Anchoring against threats that operate at civilizational scale." A pause. "Precision is a newer skill for me. I know how to apply it. It is not my first instinct when the stakes are high."

We sat with that for a moment that stretched long enough to become honest.

"Three instruments," I said finally. "Playing three different songs."

"That is a useful way to frame it," Zephyra agreed.

"It's not useful news."

"No," Elena said. "But it tells us what we're solving for." She looked at her notes. Then she looked up, the particular look she had when she was about to say something she'd been sitting on since before the session started. "I want to try something different on the next attempt. Don't reach for each other. Reach for the space between us."

"That's—" I started.

"Conceptually distinct from trying to merge, I know. I want to see what's already there before we try to add anything to it."

I looked at Zephyra. Zephyra looked at me with three thousand years of experience and said, without quite saying it, *she is probably right, you know*.

"Tomorrow morning," I said. "Let the failed attempt settle and try again fresh."

Elena wrote something in her notebook and capped her pen with the click that meant *noted, agreed, moving to next item*. "I want to run individual resonance baselines tonight. Each of us alone, establish what our natural frequency looks like in isolation before we compare them." She looked at Zephyra. "Yours will be the oldest. It might be the throughline we can all orient to."

Zephyra tilted her head, the slight inclination that I'd learned meant she found something worth considering. "I had not thought of my age as an advantage in this context."

"Your age is always an advantage," Elena said. "You've just spent three thousand years treating it like a responsibility rather than a resource." She stood up, notebook in hand. "Individual baselines tonight, second attempt tomorrow, and I want everyone to eat something that's not from a preparation tray. Morgana's cook has been leaving food in the east wing kitchen and none of us have been taking advantage of it."

She left. I listened to her footsteps recede up the passage.

"She reminds me," Zephyra said, "of what I imagine you were like when you were young. Though perhaps with more structural rigor."

"She's better than I was."

"Yes," Zephyra said simply. "That is how it is supposed to work."

---

The days that followed the first failed attempt were the kind of exhausting that settles into bone and stays.

We trained three times daily. The individual resonance baselines Elena had requested produced something interesting: each of us had, as she'd predicted, a distinct fundamental frequency. Mine was low and shifting, the way it had always been—adaptive even in isolation, with no fixed signature. Zephyra's was the deepest and most stable, an ancient pulse like a heartbeat that had been running for so long it had become geological. Elena's was rapid and complex, multiple frequencies braided together in patterns that defied easy categorization.

"We need a shared frequency," Elena said, studying the three readings she'd laid out side by side on the long worktable in the preparation room adjacent to the training hall. "Not a merged one. A harmonic relationship. Like—" She reached for an analogy and landed on something that surprised me with its simplicity. "Like different notes that belong to the same chord."

Zephyra, who had apparently studied music theory at some point in three thousand years, said: "A fifth. Or a fourth. The simplest ratios."

"Exactly. We don't have to be the same. We have to resolve."

The second attempt, on the morning of Day 11, was different from the first in the way that a door is different from a wall painted to look like one.

Instead of reaching toward each other, we reached toward the space between us—the no-man's-land of the triangle's interior, where our fields of influence already overlapped whether we intended them to or not. And in that space, paying attention for the first time rather than trying to impose structure, I noticed something I hadn't expected.

We were already there. Faintly, diffusely, in the way that three instruments in a room affect the air even when they're not being played. Decades of working in proximity, watching each other work, adjusting our approaches in response to what we'd observed. The shared layer was thin and half-formed, but it existed.

I reached toward it instead of toward them.

The link lasted four seconds before it shattered, and when it collapsed Elena's notebook hit the floor because her hand had gone involuntarily slack, and Zephyra sat down on the stone because her knees had decided they were done for the moment, and I stood in the middle of my vertex wondering what had just happened.

"Four seconds," Elena said. She was retrieving her notebook. Her voice had a quality I recognized as suppressed wonder. "That was four seconds of genuine linkage."

"I saw—" Zephyra stopped. She started again. "I saw something through your working, Riven. A flash of something. A person."

"Raechelle," I said. Because she had been there—not deliberately, not as anything I'd brought to the working consciously, but there at the periphery the way she always was when I was doing something that genuinely frightened me. An anchor. The person I'd been measuring things against for twenty-three years.

Elena had gone very still. "What does it mean that we're seeing each other's—"

"It means the link is real," I said. "It means we're actually connecting, not just approximating connection." I looked at them both. "And it means we need to decide whether that's a complication or an asset."

That question occupied us through the evening session of Day 11 and into the morning of Day 12, through multiple cups of the estate cook's excellent coffee and a great deal of Morgana's concerned hovering from the doorway of the preparation room. By the time I'd finished my second cup and my third circuit of the room, I had landed on something that hadn't been in any of Elena's working papers or Morgana's research framework or the ancient texts Corvinus had produced from his personal archive.

---

The thing I'd been looking for, without knowing I was looking for it, was something underneath the technique.

Not how we wielded power. How we thought about wielding power. The shape of the understanding rather than the mechanics of the expression.

I'd been running the failed attempts on a loop in the back of my mind since the previous morning, and I kept returning to the moment when the link had almost held—four seconds of genuine connection—and what had made it different from the zero seconds of the first attempt. The answer wasn't technical. I hadn't changed my technique between attempt one and attempt two. What I'd changed was where I was looking.

And that brought me to something I'd been ignoring in plain sight.

Elena's hybrid working style—the weaving approach, the interlocking feedback loops, the architectural precision that should have been unstable and wasn't—I'd been watching her develop it for years. I'd been, without acknowledging it to myself, incorporating pieces of it. The way I approached complex multi-stage workings had changed over the last decade, and I'd told myself it was natural refinement that came with experience. Looking at it honestly, in the aftermath of a failed training attempt, it was Elena's innovation wearing my coloring. I'd seen it work and absorbed it the way you absorb anything that works when your life depends on your craft being as good as it can possibly be.

My balancing approach—the dynamic equilibrium, the willingness to let a working's needs shape its own form—Elena used it in her governance. She'd told me early in her tenure as Voice of Balance that she'd learned to trust her instincts from watching me. I'd assumed she meant combat instincts. What I understood now, three days into a training process that was showing me how we each actually worked rather than how we described our working, was that she meant something more foundational. She didn't just do what the data said. She held multiple streams simultaneously and let them inform each other before she moved. She'd gotten that from watching me fail gracefully through twenty-five years of situations where the graceful option was the only one available.

And Zephyra. Ancient, measured Zephyra, who I'd implicitly assumed had nothing to learn from modern practitioners because she'd been practicing longer than most modern practitioners' bloodlines had existed. I watched her more carefully across the first five days of training and noticed what I'd missed entirely: she was already adapting. The techniques she used in our sessions were not the pure ancient framework she'd described. They were updated versions—the same foundational structure, ancient and massive as bedrock, but with refinements that could only have come from exposure to contemporary methods. She was doing what she'd always done: incorporating the best available understanding into her practice without announcing it, without making a pedagogical moment out of it, just quietly improving because the work required it.

We had been learning from each other for years without recognizing that we were building a shared vocabulary.

The problem wasn't incompatibility. We were less incompatible than we'd appeared. The problem was that we'd been looking for a connection to construct from scratch when we should have been uncovering the one that already existed beneath twenty years of parallel development and unacknowledged influence.

I brought this to the evening session on Day 12, at the long table in the preparation room with Morgana's research materials spread across one end and Elena's notebook open at the other. Zephyra sat with her hands folded on the table and her expression doing that thing it did when she was paying more attention than her face was advertising. Elena listened with her pen still, which was how I knew she was genuinely absorbing something rather than just adding it to the documentation structure.

"Show me," she said, when I finished.

"Tomorrow morning," I said. "Attempt seven."

"Show me now," she said. "Conceptually. Walk me through what the shared layer looks like from your side."

So I tried to describe it—the thin diffuse place where three decades of mutual observation and unacknowledged borrowing had created something that looked like common ground if you were willing to see it that way. Elena's pen started moving. Zephyra was quiet for a long time, and then she said something that surprised both of us.

"When I first agreed to train Elena," she said, "I expected to give knowledge. I expected to transmit technique from an older framework to a newer one." She was looking at the table rather than at us. "I did not expect to receive anything. It seemed unlikely, at my age, that I had anything left to receive." The particular precision with which she chose her words told me she'd been thinking about this longer than the current conversation. "I was wrong about that. I have been wrong about it for some time. I simply had not articulated it."

Elena looked at her with an expression of careful warmth. "You've been incorporating my working notes into your practice for at least three years," she said. "I noticed the second time we trained together in the Marchway configuration. I didn't say anything because I thought it might embarrass you."

"It would have," Zephyra said. And then, with a dry precision that was her version of humor: "I am glad you have apparently learned discretion."

"I learned it from watching Dad not say things," Elena said. "He's very good at strategic silence."

I had been, in fact, saying nothing for the last thirty seconds, and found this an excellent moment to continue.

---

Attempt seven was different.

We settled into the triangle with the shifted understanding of what we were looking for, and instead of reaching toward each other or toward a theoretical unified working, we reached toward the space where we already overlapped. The shared layer, thin and half-formed, that twenty years of mutual influence had put there without our knowing.

I found it immediately this time—knew what I was looking for, knew the quality of it, the particular texture of something familiar that wasn't quite any of us alone.

Elena found it from her side.

Zephyra found it from hers, and where her ancient presence touched the shared layer it deepened, the way a heavy stone deepens water—not disrupting the surface but adding weight and stability to everything beneath.

Five seconds. Then six. Then seven.

In those seven seconds I was seeing through three pairs of eyes, and the experience was nothing like anything I had a vocabulary for.

Zephyra's perspective came in as a quality of time. The world viewed from a height that I could feel the shape of but not the full dimension—power moving the way deep ocean currents move, slow and immense and carrying the memory of every direction they'd traveled. She was old in a way that I was only beginning to understand, and through the link I caught an impression of what three thousand years of continuity actually felt like: not the weight of history but the strange freedom of it, the way having outlasted so many things gave you a particular kind of uncachievable calm. She had watched civilizations fracture and reform and fracture again, and she was still here, still watching, still willing to do the work that needed doing.

And then Elena.

My daughter, present in the link as something bright and rapid and warmer than the professionalism she wore in public—her awareness shot through with the quick-fire analysis that was her native language, six things tracked simultaneously without apparent effort, and underneath all of them something steady and unafraid that I recognized as the part of her that was entirely her own. Not what I'd taught her. Not what Raechelle had given her or the Council had shaped or the twenty-six years of experience had deposited. Something that had been there from the beginning and had grown into itself rather than being built.

The link shattered.

We all sat with the absence for a moment.

"Seven seconds," Elena said. Her voice was slightly rough at the edges. She picked up her pen. Put it down again. "That was seven seconds."

"I saw—" Zephyra stopped. "I saw your son," she said. She was looking at Elena. "Just an impression. He was laughing at something."

Elena pressed her lips together and looked at the chalk marks on the floor for a moment before she looked up again. "The emotional anchors are surfacing when the link is deep enough," she said. Her voice was steady. "We discussed this as a theoretical possibility."

"Yes," I said. "And Zephyra was right that it's not interference. It's grounding." I'd been thinking about this since the first time Raechelle had appeared at the edges of my working awareness during a genuine link. "When the connection held, it wasn't because our technique was perfect. It was because of why we're doing this. That's the substrate the shared layer is built on."

Zephyra looked at me. "Then we should not resist it."

"We need to be precise about what we're sharing," Elena said. She had picked up her pen again, the click of habit, the comfort of documentation. "Not for emotional reasons—for operational ones. If a deep enough link means I'm temporarily processing your memories alongside my own, we need to know what that does to our decision-making in the working itself."

"We manage it the same way we manage everything," I said. "We practice until we know how it operates."

There was a conversation I hadn't expected to have that afternoon—with myself, which is often where the most uncomfortable conversations happen.

I sat in the preparation room after they'd gone, and I looked at Morgana's working notes spread across the worktable and I was honest with myself about something I'd been skimming past for three days.

The shared layer I'd identified—the accumulated years of mutual influence, the common ground we'd been building without knowing it—it was real. I believed it completely. But there was something underneath even that which I hadn't named yet. Something about why the emotional anchors were surfacing in the moments the link held. Why I'd seen Raechelle in four seconds of connection, why Zephyra's memory had surfaced in eleven, why Elena had stiffened at the mention of a flash of Kael.

The working, whatever it would be when we reached the real moment, was going to require something we hadn't trained for yet: holding the link while afraid. Not practicing-afraid, the low-grade tension of trying something that might fail. Actually afraid—the specific fear of combat, of being hunted, of depleted resources and the Devourer pressing in from every direction while we tried to maintain thirty seconds or forty seconds of three-way synchronization that we'd achieved for eleven under optimal conditions.

I had been in enough situations where the difference between training fear and actual fear had mattered significantly. Not insurmountably—technique held under pressure if it was solid enough—but significantly. The link we were building had to be not just technically achievable but resilient enough to hold when everything around us was doing its best to shatter it.

Which meant the emotional anchors weren't a side effect. They were load-bearing.

Raechelle in the working. Kael in the working. Zephyra's ancient commitment in the working—not as distractions but as the reason the technique had anything to hold onto when the technique alone wasn't enough. The way that soldiers talk about what they're fighting for rather than what they're fighting against, because the positive anchor is more durable than the negative one when everything is trying to collapse.

I wrote this down—a small concession to Elena's persistent argument about institutional knowledge—and left the note where she'd find it in the morning. She would work it into the framework and it would become part of the approach, because that was how Elena worked: she absorbed anything that was true and gave it structure and made it something they could train with.

This was, I thought, why the three of us were going to be capable of this. Not because we were individually the most powerful practitioners alive, though we were. But because between us we had all the approaches covered—her structure, my adaptation, Zephyra's depth—and because we were willing to actually look at what the other two were doing and learn from it rather than defending our own methods.

That had been the missing piece, all along. Not technique. Willingness.

---

The days between twelve and fifteen were the kind of exhausting that doesn't show in the body but accumulates in the way you look at everything.

Day 13: nine seconds. We'd shifted to treating the emotional anchors as structural components rather than side effects—I brought Raechelle to the working the way you bring a compass bearing, present and orienting rather than intrusive. Elena brought Kael, I thought, though she didn't name what she was carrying. Zephyra brought something I could feel the shape of but not the content: vast and old and utterly committed, the weight of everything she'd seen and survived and chosen to continue for.

Nine seconds felt, in the moment, like nearly enough time to understand what enough time would feel like.

Between sessions on Day 13, Morgana came down to observe. She sat against the wall with her clipboard and said nothing, which was what she did when she was doing serious assessment—she'd told me once, early in our collaboration, that talking during observation corrupted the observation, and she'd held to this with a consistency I'd come to find reassuring. After the third attempt she set her clipboard down and said: "The harmonic relationship is establishing. I can see it from outside the working. The anchors are functioning as I hoped."

"You hoped?" Elena asked.

"I theorized," Morgana corrected. "With significant confidence. There's a difference." She looked at her notes. "The primary risk I'm watching for is anchor divergence—the three of you holding different emotional anchors that pull in incompatible directions rather than reinforcing a unified orientation. So far that isn't happening, but I want you to be aware of it."

"What would anchor divergence look like?" I asked.

"The link would feel like pulling in three different directions simultaneously," she said. "Rather than like swimming in the same current. If that happens, release immediately and we'll work the solution." She stood, gathered her clipboard. "You're at nine seconds. You'll be at twelve tomorrow if you sleep properly tonight and don't spend the evening reviewing the session records, Elena."

Elena had been about to say something that would have started with *but the session records—* and rerouted visibly. "I'll review them briefly," she said.

"Briefly," Morgana said, and left, and Elena did review them briefly, which for Elena meant forty-five minutes rather than three hours, which counted.

Day 14: seven seconds, then eleven, then eight. Variable. The eleven-second link was the longest we'd achieved, and in it I experienced something that stopped me for the rest of the day: a flash of Zephyra's memory, specific and sudden, of watching a city fall. Not here, not this world as I knew it—a city that no longer existed in any form I would recognize. The feeling of the moment was not grief, exactly. It was the compound sensation of failure and continuity at once: she had not stopped it, and she had survived it, and both of those facts had shaped everything that came after. Three thousand years of choices made in the aftermath of not being able to save something.

She knew I'd seen it. When the link shattered, she looked at me across the triangle with an expression I could not quite name.

I said nothing. Some things don't need to be spoken to be understood. The understanding was the point.

Elena's seven-second session that afternoon produced something in her that she didn't announce and I didn't ask about directly. She went quiet for the rest of the evening in the specific way she went quiet when she was carrying something that needed processing—not withdrawn, still present and attentive in conversation, but with a quality of interior distance, like part of her attention was turned inward on something significant. I recognized it because I'd seen it before, at various points in her life when she'd encountered something that required her to revise a previous understanding. She'd come out the other side of those periods having integrated something new.

Whatever had surfaced in the seven-second link for her, she was integrating it.

I left her to it. Some things are better processed in the time they require than interrupted by well-meaning inquiry.

Day 15 arrived whether we were ready for it or not. But we were ready in the way that matters—not complete, not certain, but prepared.

---

Fifteen days until seal failure. The Devourer's intrusions had spiked twice in the last seventy-two hours, both times requiring Morgana's ward systems to absorb the kind of force that left the monitoring arrays degraded and the ward-lines needing retracing. The underground chamber bore new scorch patterns I hadn't ordered cleaned up. We needed the reminder of what was coming.

We settled into the triangle on the morning of Day 15, and I found I had nothing to say before we started. Neither did Elena. Zephyra was as still as she always was—absolute, patient, ready in a way that had nothing to do with eagerness and everything to do with three thousand years of practice accepting what was necessary.

I reached.

They reached.

And the world became very large.

I want to be precise about what ten seconds of three-way synchronization actually felt like, because large doesn't cover it and extraordinary doesn't cover it and none of the vocabulary I've accumulated across twenty-five years of doing things that didn't have precedents does it justice. It was like standing in the center of something architectural and having the architecture suddenly reveal its purpose. Three distinct working styles, three distinct histories, three distinct reasons for being here—and instead of being incompatible, they were aspects of a single approach. The way three different instruments playing three different notes of the same chord are all expressing the same harmony.

I felt the five affinities not as five separate forces I was juggling but as one coherent capability shaped by three different understandings of what it was for. Elena's structural precision giving it form. Zephyra's ancient weight giving it depth. My adaptive equilibrium giving it the flexibility to hold together under conditions that would shatter anything rigid.

I felt what we would be capable of if we could hold this long enough.

The link shattered.

The absence, afterward, was nearly painful in the way that stepping out of sunlight into shadow is nearly painful. Your body knows what it was receiving, even after it stops.

Zephyra sat down on the stone floor with the deliberate care of someone who had decided that sitting was the appropriate response to having experienced something significant. Elena stood very still with both hands pressed flat against her thighs, which was what she did when she was holding herself together around something that wanted to overflow.

"Ten seconds," she said. The steadiness in her voice was costing her something. "Ten seconds of full synchronization."

"Enough to understand what we're aiming for," Zephyra said quietly. She was looking at the far wall. "Enough to know that it is not theoretical."

"Now we make it last long enough to matter," I said.

Neither of them argued with the word *now*, though we all knew what it contained: fifteen days to extend ten seconds into however long the actual working would require, under conditions that would be nothing like a warded chamber and a chalk triangle and three people who had a chance to breathe.

Morgana appeared in the training hall doorway. She'd been monitoring from the preparation room—she had a passive observation system built into the ward structure that let her watch the external qualities of any working conducted in the chamber without needing to be present. She crossed to where we were without saying anything for a moment, and then crouched to examine the chalk marks on the floor where the power had flowed during the link.

"The distribution pattern held evenly," she said, standing. "All three vertices absorbed comparable load. The working isn't pulling harder on any one of you." She looked at each of us in turn. "That's significant. It means the harmonic relationship has genuine structural integrity, not just surface coherence."

"It's fifteen days," I said.

"It's enough time," she said, with the quality she had when she was being precise about what she actually believed rather than reassuring. "Ten seconds is genuinely enough to build from. Most working progressions of this kind reach their floor quickly and then plateau—the jump from zero to ten seconds is harder than the jump from ten to thirty, or thirty to sixty. You've cleared the hardest part." A pause. "Provided the alignment sessions continue to settle the harmonic baseline. I want to start those tonight."

"Tonight," Elena said.

"A shorter version. Thirty minutes of passive resonance baseline, not active working. Think of it as—letting the shared frequency know where home is." She said this with the careful precision of someone who was explaining something that didn't have perfect technical vocabulary yet but was real regardless. "Sleep after. Tomorrow morning we build on this."

She went. The three of us stayed in the training hall a moment longer, standing in the particular quality of a space where something significant has just happened—the air not quite back to normal, the chalk marks bearing the slight warmth that power leaves in stone when it's been genuinely flowing.

What I did not say, because they already knew it—the way you know the things that are true and don't require articulation—was that achieving this in a controlled training environment, with nothing attacking us and no fear driving our decisions and no physical depletion compounding every error, was categorically different from achieving it while the Devourer was hunting us specifically, while we were exhausted and afraid and running on whatever reserves we had left.

We'd proved it was possible.

Whether we could do it when it counted remained the question that no training session could fully answer.

Elena found me outside that evening.

I'd gone up through the estate's back passage to stand on the upper terrace—the one with the stone railing that Raechelle had insisted on rebuilding properly fifteen years ago, after she'd found me leaning on a crumbling section of old wall and had pointed out, with the particular quality of calm that was more frightening than any raised voice, that the Balance of the supernatural world probably should not die falling off his own roof. The terrace looked north. Toward the Wilds, toward Viktor's territory, toward the place where Raechelle was sleeping in a location the Devourer couldn't sense.

Spring had fully settled. The air was new leaves and the distant creek that ran along the estate's eastern boundary. After five days underground, breathing recycled air that tasted of wards and sustained effort, standing in open sky felt like stepping into a different element.

Elena came and leaned on the railing beside me. She didn't speak for several minutes. She was still processing—I could tell by the quality of her silence, which was different from peaceful silence, more structured, like someone organizing thoughts into retrievable order. I had stopped trying to hurry her past her thinking time a long time ago. It was where she did her best work.

"Are you afraid?" she asked, when she was ready.

I considered the question honestly. Elena's honest questions deserved honest answers; it was one of the things that had made her an exceptional Voice of Balance and a person I consistently found it difficult to manage, because she noticed when you were managing her and took it personally.

"Yes," I said. "But not—not the shape of afraid I expected."

She turned her head to look at me. Even in the dark I could see her expression, the particular attentiveness she had when something mattered. "What did you expect?"

"I've been in situations over the years where I thought I was going to die. The shape of that fear is familiar. I know what it is." I leaned on the stone railing and looked at the dark tree line. "This isn't that. I'm not afraid of dying. I'm not particularly afraid of losing the affinities either—I've been thinking about what I'd be without them, and it seems survivable. Strange. But survivable."

"Then what is it?"

I was quiet for a moment. "I'm afraid of failing you," I said. "You and Zephyra and Raechelle and Kael. Not failing the working—failing you. There are very few things I've been genuinely afraid of in twenty-five years, and most of them have had your names in them."

She didn't speak immediately. I went on, because I'd started and there was no useful reason to stop.

"Every time I've gone into something dangerous, the thing underneath the fear was always that specific: not my own death, but the people who would have to live with it. You. Raechelle. The supernatural community that would be left without a Balance in the middle of a crisis I'd failed to resolve." I looked at her. "I suspect I'm not particularly unique in this."

"You're not," Elena said quietly. "I feel the same thing. Not for the same people—for you, and Marcus, and Kael." She looked out at the dark. "The mathematics of the plan don't frighten me anymore. I've run them enough times that I've made a kind of peace with the probability distribution. What frightens me is the scenario where I do everything correctly and it still isn't enough. Where the working holds for seven seconds instead of however many it needs, and we fall short by exactly that margin."

"That's the scenario you can't plan for."

"No. And I've been thinking—" She stopped. Started again. "I used to believe that if I couldn't plan for a scenario, it meant I needed more information. That the gap in the plan was a solvable problem if I just worked the problem hard enough." The particular quality in her voice said this next part had cost her something to learn. "I've spent the last ten days figuring out that sometimes you plan as well as you can and then you do the work and you trust the people next to you to be doing the same. That's not—it's not resignation. It's just accurate."

"When did you get wise?" I said.

"I learned from someone," she said. And then, because she was Elena and couldn't leave softness sitting unattended without acknowledging that she'd noticed it: "He's annoyingly difficult to impress and occasionally terrible at sleeping but on balance useful."

I laughed. It felt strange in my chest, the way laughing sometimes does after enough days of sustained weight—like a muscle that's been held too long in one position finally released. Good strange.

"Dad," she said, after a moment.

"Mm."

"We're going to do this."

I looked at her. Twenty-six years old, standing in the dark with her mother's poise and her own fierce certainty, and underneath both of those things the complicated, particular person I'd watched emerge from childhood into exactly herself—the person who'd changed how the supernatural world thought about governance because she'd simply refused to accept that it couldn't be better. The person who'd looked at a three-year-old who called her Mama and found a category of love she hadn't known she was capable of. The person who was standing here with me, afraid, and choosing anyway.

"Yes," I said. "We are."

I meant it the way I meant the things that were most true—not as reassurance, not as calculated optimism, not as performance of confidence for someone who needed to hear it. As a statement of intent. We would do this because the alternative was unacceptable. It was the same reason I'd been doing things for twenty-five years. Not because I was certain of success. Because failure was something I had never learned to consider an acceptable conclusion.

"Go inside," I told her. "Sleep."

"You should also sleep."

"I will."

"That's not a yes."

"It's a commitment to a future action," I said. "The timing is contextual."

She gave me a look that was pure Raechelle—the expression that said she had seen through my deflection and found it unimpressive—and turned to go. At the door to the passage she paused. "Ten seconds felt like it was barely the beginning," she said. "Like we'd touched the edge of something much larger."

"Yes."

"Good," she said. "That means there's room to grow into it."

She went inside. I stood on the terrace a while longer, watching the north, thinking about ten seconds of understanding what was possible and fifteen days to turn possible into reliable. Behind me, the estate was quiet and warded and full of people who had committed their capabilities to a plan that had, as of this morning, shown itself to be more than theoretical.

Ahead, in fifteen days, a seal would fail.

And three Prime Archons who had been building a shared language for years without knowing it would have to hold ten seconds of synchronization for long enough to do what needed to be done.

I stayed until the night went fully cold. Then I went inside.

## Chapter Notes

**Key Events**:
- First training attempt at three-way synchronization fails immediately; Riven diagnoses the incompatibility as three distinct working styles (his adaptive equilibrium, Elena's architectural weaving, Zephyra's ancient force-application) failing to mesh
- Day 12 breakthrough realization: the three Prime Archons have been learning from each other for years unknowingly—a shared layer already exists beneath their apparent incompatibility
- Attempt seven produces four seconds of genuine linkage by reaching toward existing shared ground rather than trying to build new connection
- Day 11-14 training montage: improving from 4 seconds to 11 seconds with variable results; emotional anchors (Raechelle, Kael, Zephyra's history) surface in deep links
- Day 15 breakthrough: ten full seconds of three-way synchronization; Riven experiences all three perspectives simultaneously and understands what full convergence could enable
- Evening conversation with Elena on the north terrace: both admit their fear is not death or power-loss but failing the people they love; mutual acknowledgment of the specific shape of their fear; renewed joint commitment

**Character Development**:
- Riven established in full as a tactically systematic thinker who processes problems methodically while carrying emotional weight underneath; his love for his family shows in how he approaches the work rather than what he says about them
- Elena's dual nature (analytical Voice of Balance / terrified mother) continues from Ch. 66; her wisdom about accepting unplannable scenarios marks genuine growth from her earlier approach
- Zephyra's unexpected depth: her willingness to incorporate others' innovations, her ancient memory surfacing in the link, her dry humor with Elena—all establish her as a fully realized character rather than an obstacle or archetype

**Continuity Notes**:
- The synchronization mechanism established in Ch. 66 (tripartite harmonic resonance) is now being put into practice; the ten-second achievement is the first proof-of-concept
- Kael is safe in the north with Raechelle and Viktor; Riven thinks of Raechelle as his anchor throughout the training
- The chapter explicitly acknowledges that training-condition success does not equal combat-condition success—the central unresolved tension carrying into Act Two
- Fifteen days remain at chapter close; the Devourer's intrusion frequency is increasing (scorch marks in training hall)
