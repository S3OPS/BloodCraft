## ✅ ALL CRITICAL AND MAJOR ISSUES RESOLVED

### 1. CRITICAL: Raechelle's Hair Color Inconsistency ✅

**Problem:** Raechelle's hair was described as midnight/black (7 instances), crimson (1 instance), amber/copper (1 instance), and silver (2 instances - one aging-related, one error).

**Fixes Applied:**

| Line | Original Text | Fixed Text | Status |
|------|--------------|------------|--------|
| 4979 | "matched her hair" | "complemented her midnight hair" | ✅ Fixed |
| 5917 | "amber hair spilled across the pillow like liquid copper" | "midnight hair spilled across the pillow like dark silk" | ✅ Fixed |
| 5607 | "Her silver hair was styled" | "Her midnight hair was styled" | ✅ Fixed |

**Canonical Description:** MIDNIGHT BLACK (based on 7/10 original instances + narrative consistency)

**Verification:** 
- ✅ No remaining crimson/amber/copper hair references to Raechelle
- ✅ 10 total midnight/black hair references maintained
- ✅ Daughter Elena correctly described with "black hair that came from Raechelle"
- ✅ Silver-streaked hair in Chapter 37 retained (aging context, 15+ years later)

---

### 2. MAJOR: Terravos Age Contradiction ✅

**Problem:** Terravos described as ruling for both "thousands of years" AND "three centuries"

**Fix Applied:**

| Line | Original Text | Fixed Text | Status |
|------|--------------|------------|--------|
| 1258 | "has ruled for thousands of years" | "has ruled for centuries" | ✅ Fixed |

**Consistency:** Now matches line 1899: "has held his seat for nearly three centuries"

**Verification:**
- ✅ No remaining "thousands of years" references for Terravos
- ✅ Age consistently described as "centuries" or "three centuries"

---

### 3. MAJOR: Duplicate Chapter Content ✅

**Problem:** Chapter 20 contained duplicate content from Chapter 19.5 (Lysandra Blackwood waiting scene)

**Fix Applied:**
- **Deleted:** Lines 8504-8847 (344 lines of duplicate content from Chapter 20)
- **Retained:** Chapter 19.5 as canonical version
- **Result:** Chapter 20 now ends at line 8503, Chapter 21 begins at line 8506

**Additional Verification:**
- ✅ Chapters 23.5 and 24 are DISTINCT (not duplicates) - retained both
- ✅ Chapters 30.5 and 31 are DISTINCT (not duplicates) - retained both
- ✅ Only 1 Lysandra waiting scene remains in the entire document

## 🟡 MINOR ISSUES (No Action Required)

### Blood Archon vs Blood Mage Distinction

**Status:** INTERNALLY CONSISTENT - No fix needed

**Context:** 
- Elara (Riven's mother) was "one of the most skilled blood mages of her generation"
- Riven is "the first Blood Mage and namely thus Archon to emerge in centuries"
- **Explanation:** Archon is a higher tier than mage (Elara was a mage, Riven achieved Archon status)

This distinction is already clear in the text and doesn't require clarification.

- ✅ **Raechelle's Age Progression:** 247 years → 253 years (6 year span, correct)
