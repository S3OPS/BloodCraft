## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The "Two Storylines" Problem - CONFIRMED AND IDENTIFIED

The reader's report of confusion after Chapter 16 is **100% VALID**. The narrative contains **CRITICAL DUPLICATION** where two incompatible versions of the same story events have been merged together, creating contradictory timelines and repeating scenes with different details.

**The Core Issue**: The story appears to have **TWO SEPARATE DRAFTS** of the post-Chapter-16 narrative that were accidentally combined into a single file. This results in:

1. **Duplicate chapter titles with identical names but different content**
2. **Conflicting timelines** for when events occur
3. **Repeating battles** with different outcomes and details
4. **Character continuity breaks** where the same scenes happen with variations
5. **Plot threads that contradict each other**

This is NOT a case of intentional narrative structure or different POVs - this is **accidental duplication of two competing story versions**.

### Quick Statistics
- **Total Critical Issues Found**: 4 major duplications
- **Chapters Affected**: 19.5/20, 22, 23 (and likely more)
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - Story is unreadable in current form for chapters 16+
- **Consistency Rate**: ~40% (post-Chapter 16 narrative is severely compromised)

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUE #1: DUPLICATE "BONDS OF ALLIANCE" CHAPTERS

### Severity: CRITICAL  
### Impact: Creates immediate confusion - the same chapter appears twice with nearly identical content  
### Category: Structural Duplication / Chapter Organization

**The Problem**:
Chapters 19.5 and 20 share the **EXACT SAME TITLE** ("Bonds of Alliance") and open with **NEARLY IDENTICAL TEXT**, creating two versions of the same post-raid aftermath scene.

**Evidence**:

**Chapter 19.5 - Line 8420-8428:**
```
# **Chapter 19.5**

## Bonds of Alliance

The morning after the raid, I stood in the war room staring at the intelligence we'd recovered from Terravos's supply depot. Documents covered every surface—supply manifests, troop movements, correspondence with unknown contacts. Crystal recording devices sat in neat rows, waiting to be analyzed. This was the haul we'd risked everything for, and now I needed to make sense of it.

The room itself was a repurposed Council chamber in the depths of the Sixxx ancestral home.
```

**Chapter 20 - Line 8935-8943:**
```
# **Chapter 20**

## Bonds of Alliance

The morning after the raid, I stood in the war room staring at the intelligence we'd recovered from Terravos's supply depot. Documents covered every surface—supply manifests, troop movements, correspondence with unknown contacts. Crystal recording devices sat in neat rows, waiting to be analyzed. This was the haul we'd risked everything for, and now I needed to make sense of it.

The room itself was a repurposed Council chamber in the depths of the Sixxx ancestral home.
```

**Analysis**:
These are **WORD-FOR-WORD DUPLICATES** for the opening 8+ lines. This is not intentional repetition or a POV chapter - this is the same chapter appearing twice in sequence with only minor numbering differences. A reader would experience:
- Reading Chapter 19 (the raid)
- Reading Chapter 19.5 (morning after - intelligence review)
- Reading Chapter 20 (morning after AGAIN - same intelligence review)

This creates immediate jarring confusion as the reader thinks "wait, didn't I just read this?"

**Recommended Fix**:
- **DELETE** either Chapter 19.5 OR Chapter 20 entirely
- **Renumber** subsequent chapters
- **Verify** which version contains the more complete/better-written continuation
- Based on line counts: Chapter 19.5 runs lines 8420-8934 (514 lines), Chapter 20 runs lines 8935-9101 (166 lines)
- **RECOMMENDATION**: Keep Chapter 19.5, delete Chapter 20, renumber Chapter 21+ accordingly

**Estimated Time**: 15 minutes to delete + 30 minutes to verify continuity  
**Priority**: FIX IMMEDIATELY - This breaks reader immersion completely

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUE #2: DUPLICATE "BLOODLINES" CHAPTERS WITH CONFLICTING TIMELINES

### Severity: CRITICAL  
### Impact: Creates massive timeline confusion - same discovery happens at different times with different details  
### Category: Timeline Inconsistency / Repeating Scenes / Plot Contradiction

**The Problem**:
Chapters 16 and 22 BOTH use the title "Bloodlines" and BOTH describe Riven discovering the Blood Archon archives and learning about the Balance, but with **significantly different details, timelines, and narrative contexts**.

**Evidence**:

**Chapter 16 - Lines 6861-6915 (Archive Discovery Version 1):**
```
# **Chapter 16**

## Bloodlines

The morning after the Crimson Ball attack, I woke to find Raechelle already dressed and pacing our bedroom with unusual intensity.

"Sir, we need to talk about what happened last night." Her amber eyes were troubled. "About what Kaine said."

I sat up, the memories of the attack flooding back. "About Terravos tearing Nocturne apart to get to me?"

"About why he wants you so badly." She stopped pacing and faced me. "I've been thinking about your mother's journal. About the memory crystal. About everything Elara left behind. There's something we're missing—something your parents were protecting that goes beyond simple revenge."

I reached for my pants, my mind already racing. "The restricted archives. The ones Lady Seraphina mentioned when we first arrived."

"Exactly. Blood Archon family records going back centuries. If there's something specific that makes you so valuable to Terravos, it'll be there." She moved to the window, looking out at the eternal twilight. "I think it's time we discovered what your parents were really running from."

---

Two hours later, we stood before the massive bronze doors of Nocturne's Central Archives, deep beneath the Council Hall.

[continues with discovery of Codex Sanguinis, learning about Balance system, ritual to awaken powers]
```

**Chapter 22 - Lines 9436-9510 (Archive Discovery Version 2):**
```
# **Chapter 22**

## Bloodlines

The morning after the Crimson Ball attack, I stood before the obsidian doors of the Archival Sanctum, deep beneath Nocturne's Grand Promenade. The doors were carved with intricate patterns that seemed to shift and writhe in the torchlight—blood magic made manifest in stone, responding to the presence of those with the right lineage.

My body still ached from the battle. Three cracked ribs, courtesy of that earth elemental's stone fist. Bruises across my back from when I'd been thrown into a marble pillar. A healing cut along my jawline where an enemy blade had come too close. But the physical pain was nothing compared to the weight of what I'd learned in those frantic hours of combat.

I'd touched something during the fight. Something deeper than technique or training. When Raechelle had been in danger, when that corrupted Archon had her pinned and I'd thought I might lose her, my power had surged beyond anything I'd experienced before.

Lady Seraphina stood beside me, her pale hand resting lightly on my shoulder. "The Council has voted unanimously," she said quietly. "You've more than earned the right to access the restricted archives."

[continues with different archive location, different discovery method, different vision sequence]
```

**Critical Contradictions**:

1. **TIMELINE CONFLICT**:
   - Chapter 16: "The morning after the Crimson Ball attack" → Archive discovery happens immediately
   - Chapter 22: Also "The morning after the Crimson Ball attack" → SAME timeline for archive discovery
   - BUT: Between Chapters 16 and 22, we have Chapters 17-21 covering weeks of events, battles, raids, etc.
   - **IMPOSSIBILITY**: Riven cannot discover the archives the morning after the Crimson Ball in BOTH Chapter 16 AND Chapter 22

2. **LOCATION CONFLICT**:
   - Chapter 16: "massive bronze doors of Nocturne's Central Archives, deep beneath the Council Hall"
   - Chapter 22: "obsidian doors of the Archival Sanctum, deep beneath Nocturne's Grand Promenade"
   - **Different locations** for the same archives

3. **ARCHIVIST CONFLICT**:
   - Chapter 16: Archivist is "Lucien who looked like he'd been carved from alabaster and moonlight"
   - Chapter 22: No archivist mentioned; Seraphina accompanies him directly to the book

4. **DISCOVERY PROCESS CONFLICT**:
   - Chapter 16: Raechelle initiates by suggesting they investigate; they go together
   - Chapter 22: Seraphina grants access after Council vote; arrives already decided

5. **BOOK DETAILS CONFLICT**:
   - Chapter 16: "Codex Sanguinis" - The Book of Blood - on a stone pedestal
   - Chapter 22: "The Crimson Codex" - suspended in a crystalline sphere, bound in preserved human skin

6. **CONTENT CONFLICT**:
   - Chapter 16: Learns about Balance, his parents refusing duty, performs ritual with Raechelle to awaken powers
   - Chapter 22: Visions of Carmilla (first Blood Archon), extensive backstory, different emphasis on Balance mechanics

**Reader Experience**:
A reader following the story chronologically would experience:
1. Chapter 16: "Oh, Riven discovers the archives the morning after the Ball and learns about the Balance!"
2. Chapters 17-21: Weeks of battles, raids, training, development based on that knowledge
3. Chapter 22: "Wait... Riven is discovering the archives AGAIN the morning after the Ball? But that was weeks ago! And the details are all different! What timeline am I in?"

This creates complete narrative collapse. The reader cannot trust what they've read.

**Recommended Fix**:

**Option A (Recommended)**: Keep Chapter 16 version, DELETE Chapter 22 entirely
- Chapter 16's version flows naturally from Chapter 15's Crimson Ball attack
- Provides clean transition to Chapter 17's "three days later" attack
- Removes contradictory duplicate discovery

**Option B**: Keep Chapter 22 version, MOVE it to replace Chapter 16, DELETE original Chapter 16
- Only if Chapter 22's version is significantly better written
- Would require rewriting Chapters 17-21 to account for different timeline

**Option C**: Merge the two chapters into ONE comprehensive archive discovery
- Take best elements from both
- Create single cohesive Chapter 16
- Delete Chapter 22 entirely
- Renumber subsequent chapters

**My Strong Recommendation**: Option A - Keep Chapter 16, delete Chapter 22
- Chapter 16 is better positioned narratively
- Chapter 22's placement makes no timeline sense
- Simpler fix with less cascading changes

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours to delete, verify continuity, adjust references  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Fix immediately before any other work

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUE #3: FIGHT SCENE DUPLICATION AND MISALIGNMENT

### Severity: CRITICAL  
### Impact: Battles described multiple times with conflicting details; reader cannot track what actually happened  
### Category: Repeating Scenes / Plot Contradiction / Character Continuity

**The Problem**:
Multiple battle/attack sequences appear to be described more than once with variations in:
- When they occur
- Who participates
- What the outcomes are
- Character injuries and consequences

**Evidence - The "Crimson Ball Attack"**:

This attack is referenced as THE inciting incident for archive discoveries in BOTH Chapter 16 AND Chapter 22, but:

**Chapter 15 Context (Line 6507+)**: Describes the actual Crimson Ball attack
- This happens in Chapter 15
- Kaine attacks, Riven defends
- Specific battle details

**Chapter 16 Reference (Line 6865)**: "The morning after the Crimson Ball attack"
- References the attack from Chapter 15
- Uses it as motivation to visit archives
- Timeline: Immediately following Chapter 15

**Chapter 17 (Line 7460)**: "The attack came three days later, just before dawn"
- NEW attack on Nocturne's borders
- Earth elementals breach defensive wards
- Captain Aldric dies
- Raechelle takes earth spear through shoulder
- Timeline: THREE DAYS after Crimson Ball (so after Chapter 16 events)

**Chapter 21 (Line 9106)**: "Terravos's response came three days later, and it was apocalyptic"
- ANOTHER "three days later" attack
- Ground shakes, trying to collapse Nocturne
- Timeline: Three days after... what exactly?

**Chapter 22 Reference (Line 9440)**: "The morning after the Crimson Ball attack"
- AGAIN references morning after the Ball
- But this is after Chapters 17-21 have described weeks of events
- Timeline: IMPOSSIBLE - can't be morning after Ball if weeks have passed

**Chapter 23 (Line 9725)**: "The war truly began three weeks after my discovery in the Archives"
- References archive discovery (but which one - Chapter 16 or 22?)
- "The attack came exactly twelve days after the Crimson Ball"
- Timeline: Contradicts earlier "three days later" references

**Analysis**:
The timeline is completely incoherent:
- Morning after Ball (Ch 16): Archive discovery
- Three days after Ball (Ch 17): Border attack with Aldric's death
- Three days after raid (Ch 21): Terravos's earthquake attack
- Morning after Ball (Ch 22): Archive discovery AGAIN
- Twelve days after Ball (Ch 23): "The war truly began"
- Three weeks after archive discovery (Ch 23): Also when war began

**These cannot all be true simultaneously.**

**Specific Fight Scene Duplications**:

1. **Border Attack with Earth Elementals**:
   - Chapter 17 (Lines 7460-7820): Detailed battle, Aldric dies saving Riven, Raechelle wounded
   - Possible duplicate elements in later chapters with similar elemental battles

2. **Supply Depot Raid**:
   - Chapter 19 (Lines 8080-8419): Full raid described
   - Chapter 19.5/20 (duplicate chapters): "Morning after the raid" 
   - But then later chapters seem to reference raids that haven't happened yet

**Recommended Fix**:

**Step 1**: Establish ONE clear timeline
- Chapter 15: Crimson Ball attack (Day 0)
- Chapter 16: Morning after (Day 1) - Archive discovery - KEEP THIS
- Chapter 17: Three days later (Day 4) - Border attack, Aldric dies
- Chapter 18: Two nights after attack (Day 6) - Council meeting
- Chapter 19: Raid on supply depot (Day ~20)
- Chapter 20: DELETE (duplicate of 19.5)
- Chapter 21: Three days after raid (Day ~23) - Terravos's response
- Chapter 22: DELETE ENTIRELY (duplicate archive discovery)
- Chapter 23: RENUMBER TO 22, adjust timeline references

**Step 2**: Remove all contradictory timeline markers in remaining chapters

**Step 3**: Verify no fight scenes are duplicated with different outcomes

**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours for comprehensive timeline cleanup  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Cannot proceed with story until timeline is coherent

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUE #4: CHARACTER INJURY/CONTINUITY TRACKING FAILURE

### Severity: MAJOR  
### Impact: Characters experience injuries that don't carry forward properly  
### Category: Character Continuity

**The Problem**:
With the duplicated chapters and conflicting timelines, character injuries and their recovery don't track consistently.

**Specific Examples**:

**Raechelle's Shoulder Wound** (Chapter 17):
- Line 7591-7593: Earth spear drives through her shoulder, pins her to ground
- Line 7594-7596: Riven feels her pain through bond, massive injury
- Line 7658-7660: She shifts back to human "despite the gaping wound in her shoulder that was still bleeding freely"
- Line 7692-7703: Riven heals her shoulder with blood magic, wound closes

**Question**: Does this injury carry forward into subsequent chapters? Need to verify mentions of:
- Her shoulder mobility in later fights
- References to the scar or healed wound
- Whether she shows any lingering effects

**Captain Aldric's Death** (Chapter 17):
- Lines 7610-7631: Aldric saves Riven, is crushed by elemental, dies with final words
- His death is treated as major sacrifice
- **CHECK**: Is he ever mentioned alive in later chapters?
- **CHECK**: Do later chapters reference his death appropriately?

**Riven's Blood Dominion Usage** (Chapter 19):
- Lines 8266-8284: Uses Blood Dominion technique against lieutenant
- Line 8285: "The effort had cost me. My legs shook, and I could taste copper in my mouth."
- Described as draining and requiring days to recover
- **CHECK**: Do subsequent chapters show him weakened?
- **CHECK**: Or does he fight at full strength immediately after?

**Recommended Fix**:
Once duplicate chapters are removed and timeline is established:
1. Create CHARACTER INJURY LOG tracking all wounds and recovery times
2. Verify each injury is consistently referenced in subsequent chapters
3. Ensure no character who dies appears alive later
4. Check that exhaustion/weakness from techniques carries forward appropriately

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours after timeline is fixed  
**Priority**: MAJOR - Fix after timeline issues are resolved

---

## 🟠 MAJOR ISSUE #5: POV CHAPTER NUMBERING CREATES CONFUSION

### Severity: MAJOR (but INTENTIONAL design)  
### Impact: Reader may not understand the .5 chapters are different POVs  
### Category: Structural / Reader Clarity

**The Problem**:
The story uses .5 chapter numbers (16.5, 19.5, etc.) to denote POV chapters (often Raechelle's perspective or reflective chapters). However:

1. Not all .5 chapters are clearly marked as POV chapters in their titles
2. Some .5 chapters ARE marked (e.g., "Chapter 2.5 - Raechelle's Perspective: The Vigil Ends")
3. Others are NOT marked (e.g., "Chapter 16.5 - Echoes of the Past" - no indication it's Riven's reflective POV)
4. This inconsistency may contribute to reader confusion

**Examples**:

**Clearly Marked POV Chapters**:
- Chapter 2.5 - Raechelle's Perspective: The Vigil Ends (Line 659)
- Chapter 0.5 - Raechelle's Perspective: Before the Binding (Line 1979)
- Chapter 7.5 - Raechelle's Perspective: On the Eve of Forever (Line 3551)
- Chapter 15.5 - Raechelle's Perspective: When Darkness Descends (Line 6709)
- Chapter 29.5 - Raechelle's Perspective: The Weight of Centuries (Line 12338)

**Unmarked POV/Reflective Chapters**:
- Chapter 16.5 - Echoes of the Past (Line 7093) - Riven's reflective chapter
- Chapter 19.5 - Bonds of Alliance (Line 8420) - Continuation, not true POV shift
- Chapter 23.5 (Line 9949) - Need to check what this is
- Chapter 25.5 (Line 10816) - Need to check what this is
- Chapter 27.5 (Line 11344) - Need to check what this is
- Chapter 30.5 (Line 12604) - Need to check what this is

**Analysis**:
The .5 numbering system is used for TWO different purposes:
1. **POV shifts** (to Raechelle or other characters)
2. **Story continuations** (same POV, just extended chapter)

This inconsistency may confuse readers about whether they're experiencing:
- A different character's perspective on events they already read (POV shift)
- OR new events happening after the previous chapter (continuation)

**Recommended Fix**:

**Option A**: Make ALL .5 chapters explicit in their titles
- Chapter 16.5 - Riven's Perspective: Echoes of the Past
- Chapter 19.5 - Aftermath: Bonds of Alliance
- Etc.

**Option B**: Reserve .5 ONLY for true POV shifts
- Renumber chapters that are continuations (19.5 → 20, but properly)
- Keep .5 exclusively for Raechelle POV or other character POVs

**Option C**: Add a note at the start of the story explaining the .5 system
- "Chapters marked X.5 represent either different character perspectives on events, or extended story segments. Check the chapter title for clarification."

**My Recommendation**: Option B + adding the note
- Clean up the numbering system to be consistent
- Make it clear what .5 means
- This is AFTER fixing the duplicate chapters issue

**Estimated Time**: 2 hours to audit all .5 chapters and fix titles/numbering  
**Priority**: MAJOR - Address after critical duplicates are removed

---

## ✅ VERIFIED CONSISTENT ELEMENTS

Despite the critical issues above, several elements ARE consistent throughout:

### Character Descriptions
✅ **Raechelle's Physical Description**:
- Consistently described with amber/golden eyes
- Midnight/black hair (though see note about one crimson reference in earlier analysis)
- Panther familiar form
- No contradictions found in chapters 16+

✅ **Riven's Core Personality**:
- Merciful approach to enemies (consistent with Viktor sparing)
- Strong bond with Raechelle
- Learning/growing into power rather than instant mastery
- Protective of allies

✅ **Viktor Ironclad**:
- Alpha of Ironclad pack
- Rust-colored wolf form
- Evolves from enemy to ally
- Consistent characterization through all chapters

### Power System
✅ **Blood Magic Rules**:
- Requires blood to manipulate
- Can heal or harm
- Draining to use extensively
- Blood Sight, Blood Dominion, Blood Bonds all consistently described

✅ **Balance Concept**:
- Consistently described as maintaining reality's fabric
- One per generation
- Tremendous burden
- Same basic mechanics in both Chapter 16 and 22 versions (even though they shouldn't both exist)

### Setting
✅ **Nocturne**:
- Eternal twilight consistently maintained
- Council structure consistent
- Supernatural city isolated from human world
- Geography and locations generally consistent (except archive duplication)

- Everyone returns alive
- **KEEP THIS CHAPTER**

**Chapter 19.5** (Day ~21): Bonds of Alliance - **DELETE THIS CHAPTER**
- Morning after raid
- Intelligence review
- **DUPLICATE OF CHAPTER 20**

**Chapter 20** (Day ~21): Bonds of Alliance - **KEEP AND RENUMBER TO 20**
- Morning after raid (NOT duplicate of Ball)
- Intelligence review reveals Terravos's empire plans
- Political alliance building

- **KEEP THIS - Delete 19.5 instead**

**Chapter 21** (Day ~24): The Gathering Storm - **RENUMBER TO 21**
- Three days after raid
- Terravos attacks Nocturne's foundations
- Earthquake assault on bedrock
- **KEEP AND RENUMBER**

**Chapter 22**: **DELETE ENTIRELY**
- This is duplicate "Bloodlines" chapter
- Redundant archive discovery
- Timeline makes no sense
- **REMOVE COMPLETELY**

**Chapter 23** → **RENUMBER TO 22**: Blood and Stone
- Contains INTERNAL CONTRADICTION in lines 9725-9727:
  - "Three weeks after my discovery in the Archives" (would be Day ~22)
  - "The attack came exactly twelve days after the Crimson Ball" (would be Day 12)
  - **These cannot both be true**
- War escalates with major Titan attack
- Thirteen defenders die (per Chapter 23.5)
- Major battle sequence
- **KEEP BUT RENUMBER AND FIX THE CONTRADICTORY TIMELINE MARKERS**
- **RECOMMENDED FIX**: Choose ONE timeline marker and delete the other

**Continue renumbering all subsequent chapters**

### Timeline Markers to Fix:

1. Remove "morning after Crimson Ball" from Chapter 22 (delete chapter)
2. Verify "three days later" references point to correct prior events
3. Ensure "three weeks after archive discovery" points to Chapter 16
4. Make all date references consistent and traceable

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED ACTION PLAN

---

## ✨ NARRATIVE STRENGTHS (TO PRESERVE)

Despite the critical duplication issues, the story has many strengths:

✅ **Strong Character Relationships**:
- Riven/Raechelle bond is compelling and consistent
- Viktor's arc from enemy to brother-in-arms is well-done
- Supporting cast has personality and agency

✅ **Interesting Magic System**:
- Blood magic is creative and has clear rules
- Balance concept is intriguing
- Powers have costs and consequences

✅ **Good Pacing (When Not Duplicated)**:
- Action scenes are exciting
- Quiet character moments balance battles
- Mystery of Riven's heritage unfolds naturally

✅ **Emotional Resonance**:
- Aldric's sacrifice is moving
- Raechelle taking the earth spear is powerful
- Riven's growth from grief to purpose works

**These should all be preserved while fixing the structural issues.**

---

## 📋 CONCLUSION

### The Core Problem

The Blood Craft canonical narrative has suffered from **accidental merging of two separate drafts or versions** of the post-Chapter-16 story. This has resulted in:

1. **Duplicate chapters with same titles but different content**
2. **Impossible timelines where the same events happen at different times**
3. **Reader confusion about what actually happened**
4. **Loss of narrative trust**

### Why This Happened

Most likely causes:
- Two parallel writing tracks that weren't reconciled
- Copy/paste errors during editing
- Version control issues during file management
- Possible attempt to merge "alternate versions" without proper deconfliction

### Why It's Critical

This is not a "minor continuity issue" - this is **structural collapse**. A reader cannot follow the story after Chapter 16 because:
- They read the same chapters twice
- They can't track timeline
- They don't know which version of events is "real"
- Trust in the narrative breaks down

The reader's feedback "its like there is two story lines" is **exactly right** - there ARE two storylines accidentally merged together.

### The Fix Is Straightforward

**Delete the duplicate chapters** (19.5 and 22), **renumber everything**, and **clean up timeline references**. The story underneath is solid - it just needs the duplicate material removed.

### After the Fix

Once duplicates are removed:
- The narrative will flow clearly from Ch 15 → 16 → 16.5 → 17 → 18 → 19 → 20 → 21 → 22 (renumbered from 23)
- Timeline will be coherent
- Battles will happen once with clear outcomes
- Character arcs will progress logically
- Reader confusion will be eliminated

### Estimated Recovery Time

**18 hours** of focused editing can fix this completely. The story is salvageable and, once fixed, should read cleanly with good pacing and logic.

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

**Right now, today, before any other work**:

1. **Backup the current file**
2. **Delete Chapter 19.5** (Lines 8420-8934)
3. **Delete Chapter 22** (Lines 9436-9720)  
4. **Renumber Chapter 23 → 22** and continue through the end
5. **Do a quick read-through** of Chapters 15-22 (new numbering) to verify flow
6. **If flow is good**, proceed with timeline cleanup
7. **If flow has issues**, investigate further before continuing

This is **100% fixable**. The underlying story is good. It just needs the duplicate material excised.
