## 🎯 The Core Insight

When Raechelle says **"I harbor some insecurities about that side of me due to past experiences"** and prepares to reveal her cat form, readers need to **KNOW those experiences IMMEDIATELY**, not remember them vaguely from 15,000 words ago.

**The difference:**
- Distant context: "That's cute" (4/10) 😊
- Fresh context: "I'm ugly crying at 2am" (10/10) 😭

## 🔄 Rollback Plan (If Needed)

## 💡 Key Quotes

> "Temporal proximity equals emotional devastation.  
> Emotional devastation equals reader investment.  
> Reader investment equals better story."

> "The difference between vague memory and vivid understanding  
> is the difference between 'That's nice' and 'I'm ugly crying at 2am.'"

> "When Raechelle reveals her cat form after we JUST learned about  
> her mother teaching her to shift, the forced bonding that stripped  
> her freedom, Damien's death, 200 years alone... THAT'S when  
> 'I harbor some insecurities' becomes DEVASTATING."
