## The Transitions

### Entry Transition (Into Flashback)
```markdown
---

*[As Raechelle hesitates, preparing to reveal her most vulnerable self, memories flood through her mind—memories of who she was, what she became, and the centuries of pain and loss that brought her to this moment...]*

---
```

### Return Transition (Back to Present)
```markdown
---

*[The memories fade, and Raechelle returns to the present moment—standing in the cabin, looking at Riven with centuries of hope and fear reflected in her eyes. This is the moment. After 247 years, someone will finally see her true self.]*

---
```

## Key Lines That Gain New Weight

### Line ~1818: "No man has touched me in over 200 years."
**With fresh context:** Readers just learned about Damien's death, her survival, her vow never to bond again. This line becomes devastating.

### Line ~1841: "I harbor some insecurities about that side of me due to past experiences."
**With fresh context:** Readers just learned about her mother teaching her to shift, the freedom it represented, the forced bonding, 200 years of hiding. This becomes soul-deep vulnerability.

### Line ~1891: Riven: "You are the embodiment of everything I have ever fantasized about."
**With fresh context:** Readers understand he's healing 247 years of trauma, accepting what others judged, giving her freedom back.
