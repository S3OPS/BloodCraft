## ⚠️ CRITICAL RISKS TO MANAGE

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY

**1. Pacing Degradation**
- Risk: Tripling length makes chapters feel sluggish
- Mitigation: Vary rhythm, use hooks every 2-3 pages, cut anything that doesn't earn its place

**2. Voice Consistency**
- Risk: Different writing sessions = voice drift
- Mitigation: Create character voice guides, re-read originals before adding, consistent editor review

**3. Continuity Errors**
- Risk: 180,000 new words = many opportunities for contradiction
- Mitigation: Comprehensive continuity bible, track everything, cross-reference constantly

### 🟠 MEDIUM PRIORITY

**4. Redundancy and Repetition**
- Risk: Adding similar content to multiple chapters
- Mitigation: Track what's already shown, vary how similar events play out

**5. Quality Consistency**
- Risk: Fatigue leading to lower quality in later chapters
- Mitigation: Pace the work, regular breaks, consistent editing standards

## 📋 RECOMMENDED PROCESS

### Phase 1: Preparation (2-3 weeks)
