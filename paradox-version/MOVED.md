# Paradox Version Has Moved

The Blood Craft: Paradox Version content has been moved to its own dedicated repository for clarity and independent development.

## New Location

🔗 **[BloodCraftParadox Repository](https://github.com/S3OPS/BloodCraftParadox)**

## What Was Moved

All Paradox version content has been transferred:
- Complete 30-chapter novel (~97,000 words)
- Structural outlines (Book1.md, Book2.md, Book3.md)
- Chapter summaries and timeline
- Development documentation
- Contribution guidelines

## Why the Move?

The Paradox version has been separated into its own repository to:
- Provide clearer focus for each storyline
- Enable independent development
- Simplify navigation and contribution
- Allow version-specific issue tracking
- Reduce confusion between two distinct narratives

## For Readers

If you're looking for the Paradox version of Blood Craft (the psychological thriller with the major twist), please visit the new repository:

## For Contributors

Please direct all Paradox version contributions to the new repository. This repository (BloodCraft) now focuses exclusively on the Canonical version.

## What Happened to the Content Here?

This directory (`paradox-version/`) contains the archived original content. It remains here for historical reference, but all active development and the most current version are now in the BloodCraftParadox repository.
