## 💡 Example Transformations

### Example 1: Power Reference
**Before:**  
> "Not the gentle, cultivated warmth of a bond carefully nurtured over time, but the wild, untamed inferno of a Blood Archon's power erupting for the first time."

**After:**  
> "Not the gentle, cultivated warmth of a bond carefully nurtured over time, but the wild, untamed inferno of ancient power erupting for the first time."

### Example 2: Descriptive Use
**Before:**  
> "He looked so young like this. So vulnerable. Nothing like the powerful Blood Archon he was destined to become."

**After:**  
> "He looked so young like this. So vulnerable. Nothing like the powerful mage he was destined to become."

### Example 3: Relationship Reference
**Before:**  
> "I'd watched the tragedy unfold with my own mentor, Serafine, who'd loved her Blood Archon too much and lost him to a rival's poison."

**After:**  
> "I'd watched the tragedy unfold with my own mentor, Serafine, who'd loved her charge too much and lost him to a rival's poison."

### Example 4: Preserved (Formal Introduction)
**Kept Unchanged:**  
> "Damien Nightshade. Reluctant Blood Archon, mediocre violinist, and apparently your destined match."

*Preserved because this is a formal character introduction.*
