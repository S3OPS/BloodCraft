# **Chapter 4**

## The Familiar Bond

Consciousness returned in fragments.

First, sensation: the soft cushion of fabric beneath me, warmer than expected. The smell of aged wood and dust, familiar in a way that should have been comforting but wasn't. My parents' sofa. Home.

Then, pain: not the sharp agony I'd expected after being thrown through the air by an explosion of wild magic, but a deeper ache—the kind that settled into bones and whispered of fundamental changes. My body felt both heavier and lighter than it should, as if gravity itself had become uncertain about how to hold me.

Finally, awareness: I wasn't alone.

My eyes cracked open, and even that small movement felt momentous. The world swam into focus with terrifying clarity—every detail of the water-stained ceiling above me rendered in perfect definition, every mote of dust suspended in the moonlight through the window visible like tiny galaxies. I could hear the house settling around me, the creak of old wood expanding and contracting, the whisper of wind through gaps in the siding. The sensations were overwhelming, each one amplified beyond anything I'd ever experienced.

"Easy." Her voice came from somewhere to my left, soft and melodious, carrying a weight of concern that felt almost tangible. "Don't try to sit up yet. Your body has been through significant trauma."

Raechelle. The woman—no, the *vampire*—who had revealed herself in the aftermath of my parents' murder. The familiar bound to my bloodline. The person whose very existence confirmed that everything I thought I knew about reality was a comfortable lie.

I turned my head toward her voice, and the movement sent the room spinning. She materialized from the shadows like a wraith, perching on the edge of the coffee table with preternatural stillness. Her crimson eyes glowed faintly in the darkness, twin points of ember-light that should have frightened me but somehow didn't. In the dim illumination, I could see the concern etched across her pale, freckled features.

"What—" My voice came out as a rasp, my throat desert-dry. "What happened?"

"Your awakening." She leaned forward slightly, and I caught her scent—something between night-blooming flowers and old parchment, with an underlying note of copper that made my stomach clench with an unfamiliar hunger. "When you drank the blood elixir, it triggered the manifestation of your Archon abilities. The power surge was... unprecedented. I've witnessed dozens of awakenings over the centuries, but nothing like yours."

Memories surfaced through the fog: the hidden compartment in my mother's bedroom, the journal, the letter explaining the impossible. The vial of crimson liquid I'd consumed without hesitation, desperate for answers, for connection, for anything that would make sense of the nightmare my life had become.

And then... pain. Ecstasy. Power erupting through every cell of my body like wildfire, uncontrolled and consuming. I remembered being lifted off my feet, magic of every color spiraling around me in a kaleidoscope of raw energy. I remembered screaming—whether in agony or exhilaration, I couldn't say. I remembered Raechelle's face, her eyes wide with shock and something that might have been awe.

I remembered falling.

"How long?" I asked, finally managing to push myself up on my elbows despite the protest of muscles that felt like they'd been thoroughly beaten.

"Three hours." Raechelle's gaze tracked my movements with predatory intensity, though I sensed no threat in it. "You collapsed after the power surge. I caught you before you hit the ground and brought you down here. You've been unconscious ever since."

Three hours. Three hours since my world had literally exploded with magic, since I'd learned that vampires and Archons and blood magic were real, since I'd accepted that I would never be normal again. Three hours since my parents had been murdered by Terravos, the Earth Archon, for the crime of birthing me.

The grief hit me then, a tidal wave I'd been holding back while my mind grappled with impossibilities. Mom. Dad. Gone. Dead because of what I was, because of a heritage I'd never asked for and didn't understand. Dead because they'd tried to protect me from a world I didn't even know existed.

"I should have been there," I whispered, the words torn from somewhere deep in my chest. "I should have—"

"You would have died." Raechelle's voice was gentle but firm, allowing no room for argument. "Terravos is an Archon who has ruled for thousands of years. Even awakened, you wouldn't have survived a direct confrontation with him. Your parents knew that. It's why they made the choices they did."

"That doesn't make it hurt less."

"No," she agreed softly. "It doesn't. And it shouldn't. They were good people, Riven. Extraordinary people. They deserve to be mourned."

I closed my eyes, fighting back the tears that threatened to spill. I couldn't fall apart. Not now. Not when I still had so much to understand, so much to learn if I wanted to survive in this new reality. The time for grief would come—I knew it would consume me eventually—but right now, I needed to stay focused.

When I opened my eyes again, the room had somehow gotten brighter, though the moon was in the same position outside the window. It took me a moment to realize the change wasn't external—my vision had simply... improved. Enhanced. I could see colors in the darkness that shouldn't have been visible, could distinguish textures and gradations of shadow with impossible precision.

"My eyes," I said, more statement than question. "Everything's different."

"You're a vampire now." Raechelle's expression was carefully neutral, watching me closely for any sign of panic or rejection. "Or at least, partly one. The blood elixir was designed to awaken your Blood Archon abilities, but it also initiated your transformation into a child of blood. Your senses will be heightened—sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch—all of them beyond human capacity."

As if her words had flipped a switch, I became abruptly aware of *everything*. The sound of my own heartbeat, steady and strong in my chest. The rustle of Raechelle's clothes as she breathed. The distant hoot of an owl in the woods outside. The smell of dust and old books from my father's den, the lingering scent of my mother's perfume from the cushions beneath me, the salt-and-copper smell of dried blood—whose?—somewhere in the house.

It was too much. The sensory overload crashed over me like a physical weight, and I gasped, pressing my palms against my temples as if that could somehow block out the overwhelming flood of information.

"Breathe, Riven." Raechelle was suddenly beside me on the sofa, one cool hand resting on my shoulder. The contact was immediate and profound—I could feel the steady calm of her presence like an anchor in a storm. "Focus on my voice. Let everything else fade to background noise. You can learn to filter it, to control what you pay attention to, but right now you need to center yourself."

I latched onto her words like a lifeline, letting the melodious tone of her voice become the only thing that mattered. Slowly, incrementally, the chaos of sensory input began to recede, sorting itself into manageable layers. It was still there—I could still hear and smell and see everything—but it no longer felt like it was tearing me apart from the inside.

"Good," she murmured, her thumb tracing small circles on my shoulder through the fabric of my shirt. "That's good. It gets easier with practice. Soon you won't even have to think about it."

"Is it always like this?" I asked, my voice steadier now. "For vampires?"

"The transition period is always challenging," she admitted. "But you're experiencing a compounded effect—you're not just becoming a vampire, you're also awakening as a Blood Archon. The two transformations are feeding into each other, amplifying everything. Your senses will stabilize in a few days, once your body adjusts to the changes."

A few days. I had a few days to learn to navigate a world that had suddenly become overwhelming in its detail and complexity. A few days to master abilities I didn't understand and hadn't asked for. A few days before—what? Before Terravos's agents came looking for me? Before I had to face the consequences of being what I was?

"Riven." Raechelle's voice pulled me back from the spiral of anxious thoughts. "There's something else you need to know. Something you're probably already feeling but might not understand yet."

I turned to look at her fully, and that's when I noticed it: the hunger. It had been there since I woke up, a low-grade gnawing in my gut that I'd dismissed as stress or adrenaline. But now that she'd mentioned it, now that I was paying attention, I couldn't ignore how it intensified when I looked at her. Not sexual desire—though there was an undercurrent of that too, confusing and inappropriate given the circumstances—but something more primal. More immediate.

Her neck. I couldn't stop staring at the pale column of her throat, at the subtle pulse of blood beneath alabaster skin. I could hear it, the steady rhythm of her heart pumping life through her veins. I could smell it, the rich copper-and-wine scent that made my mouth water and my canines—when had they gotten sharper?—ache with need.

"You need to feed," she said quietly, and there was no judgment in her voice, only patient understanding. "The transformation and the awakening have depleted your reserves. Your body is demanding blood to complete the change, to fuel the magic settling into your bones."

I jerked back from her as if burned, horror flooding through me. "No. No, I can't—I won't—"

"Riven." She reached for me but stopped short of touching, giving me space even as her eyes pleaded for me to listen. "This isn't a choice. This is biology, magical biology perhaps, but biology nonetheless. If you don't feed soon, the hunger will only get worse. You'll lose control, and when that happens, you'll hurt someone. Possibly kill them. Is that what you want?"

"Of course not!" The words came out sharper than I intended, edged with the panic clawing at my chest. "But I can't just—I can't drink someone's blood! That's—"

"Natural," she finished, her voice still impossibly calm. "For what you are now, it's completely natural. I'm not suggesting you hunt random humans in the street, Riven. I'm offering you my blood, freely given. I'm a vampire too, remember? My blood will sustain you without harm to me."

I stared at her, torn between the visceral need clawing at my insides and the horror of what she was suggesting. Images from countless movies and TV shows flickered through my mind—vampires as monsters, as predators, as creatures who killed without remorse. Was that what I was now? Was that what I was becoming?

"Hey." Raechelle's voice softened, and this time when she reached out, she cupped my face with both hands, forcing me to meet her crimson gaze. "Look at me. Really look at me. Do I seem like a monster to you?"

I took a shaky breath, forcing myself to see past the preconceptions and stereotypes, to really observe the woman before me. I saw concern in her eyes, compassion, determination. I saw centuries of wisdom tempered with genuine kindness. I saw someone who had lost my parents too, who had served my family for longer than I'd been alive, who was trying desperately to help me survive in a world I didn't understand.

"No," I admitted quietly. "You don't."

"Because I'm not," she said firmly. "And neither are you. Being a vampire doesn't make you a monster, Riven. Your choices do that, your actions, not the circumstances of your existence. You can be a vampire and still be good, still be kind, still be the person your parents raised you to be."

The knot of panic in my chest loosened slightly, though the hunger remained, a persistent ache that wouldn't be denied much longer.

"How does it work?" I asked, hating how my voice shook. "If I... if I accept this."

A small smile curved her lips, the first I'd seen since I'd regained consciousness. "It's actually quite simple. I'll bare my wrist, and you'll drink. Not much—just enough to ease the hunger and stabilize your system. A few swallows should suffice for now."

She made it sound so casual, so normal, as if we were discussing tea rather than blood-drinking. But I supposed for her, it *was* normal. She'd been doing this for centuries, had probably fed countless vampires in her time serving my family.

"Will it hurt?" I asked. "For you, I mean?"

Her smile widened, genuine warmth flooding her features. "No, Riven. For vampires, being fed from can be quite... pleasant, actually. It's an intimate act, a sharing of essence. You don't need to worry about harming me."

Intimate. The word sent a flutter of something complicated through my chest—part anxiety, part anticipation, part that same confusing attraction I'd been fighting since I first saw her face clearly. This was too much, too fast, but what choice did I have? The hunger was getting worse by the moment, and I trusted her enough to believe that she wouldn't steer me wrong.

"Okay," I whispered. "Okay, I'll try."

Raechelle shifted position, angling her body toward me and rolling up the sleeve of her dark shirt to bare her left wrist. In the moonlight, her skin seemed to glow, translucent and perfect. I could see the delicate tracery of veins beneath the surface, could hear the rush of blood through them like a river calling me home.

"Go ahead," she murmured, holding her wrist toward me. "Follow your instincts. Your body knows what to do."

I took her wrist in both hands, marveling at how cool her skin felt against my palms, how delicate the bones seemed beneath my grip. This close, her scent was intoxicating—flowers and parchment and that underlying copper that made the hunger roar to life with renewed intensity.

My canines ached, and I realized with a start that they'd elongated, sharpening into proper fangs. Some distant part of my mind wanted to panic at that, to recoil from this final proof of what I was becoming, but the hunger overrode everything else.

I brought her wrist to my mouth, hesitated for just a heartbeat, then bit down.

The pierce of skin was easier than I'd expected, my new fangs sliding through her flesh like hot knives through butter. Blood welled up immediately, rich and sweet, and I sealed my lips over the wound and *drank*.

It was like nothing I'd ever experienced. The blood flowed over my tongue, warm and metallic-sweet, and every cell in my body sang with recognition and relief. Power flooded through me—not the explosive, uncontrolled surge of the awakening, but something steadier, more grounding. Strength flowing into muscles, clarity sharpening thoughts, the chaotic hunger finally, *finally* beginning to ease.

I heard Raechelle gasp, felt her free hand come up to rest on the back of my head, fingers tangling gently in my hair. The gesture was intimate, grounding me in the moment, in the connection forming between us. Through the taste of her blood, I could feel... something. An echo of her emotions, perhaps? Contentment, relief, and beneath that, something warmer that I didn't have words for.

*Enough.*

The thought wasn't mine—or at least, it didn't feel like it originated from me. It was gentle but firm, a boundary being set, and I immediately pulled back, releasing her wrist. The wounds closed almost instantly, vampire healing knitting the punctures shut until only two small pink marks remained.

I sat back against the sofa, breathing hard despite not needing the oxygen as much as I once had. The hunger had receded to a manageable background sensation, no longer the screaming demand it had been moments before. More than that, I felt *good*—strong, centered, more present in my own body than I had been since waking up.

"How do you feel?" Raechelle asked, her voice slightly breathless as she lowered her wrist and rolled her sleeve back down.

"I—" I had to search for words. "Better. Clearer. Like I was trying to function underwater before, and now I can finally breathe."

She nodded, satisfaction evident in her expression. "Good. The feeding will help stabilize your transformation. You'll need to feed regularly—probably daily for the first week or so, then less frequently as your body adjusts. I can provide for you until you're comfortable seeking other sources."

Other sources. Right. Because I couldn't just feed exclusively from Raechelle forever, no matter how much easier that would be than finding willing donors or however else vampires managed their sustenance.

"Thank you," I said, and I meant it with every fiber of my being. "For this. For everything. I know I'm... this is all..." I gestured vaguely, unable to articulate the maelstrom of emotions churning inside me.

"You're welcome." She shifted closer, and I became aware once again of how small the sofa was, how proximate we were sitting. "I know this is overwhelming, Riven. I know you're grieving and confused and probably terrified, even if you're trying not to show it. But you're not alone in this. You're never alone. That's what the familiar bond means."

"My mother's letter mentioned that," I said, latching onto the topic gratefully. "But I didn't fully understand. She said you were bound to me, that we had met when I was a child, but that they had cast a spell to make us forget until... until I was ready, I guess."

Raechelle's expression grew complicated—part sorrow, part hope, part something I couldn't quite identify. "The bond between a familiar and their master is one of the most powerful connections in supernatural existence," she said carefully. "It goes deeper than friendship, beyond simple loyalty. We are, quite literally, two halves of a greater whole. My magic is bound to yours, my life to yours, my very existence intertwined with yours in ways that can't be easily broken."

"That sounds..." I struggled to find an appropriate word. "Intense."

A ghost of a smile. "It is. But it's also beautiful, Riven. To have someone who understands you completely, who is always on your side, who would die before letting harm come to you—there's a comfort in that. A strength."

"And you feel that?" I asked, searching her face. "For me? Even though we just met—or re-met, I guess?"

"I do." She said it simply, without hesitation or embarrassment. "I've been bound to the Sixxx bloodline for centuries, serving your ancestors with loyalty and devotion. But the bond with you..." She paused, seeming to choose her words carefully. "It's different. Stronger. Your mother mentioned in her letter that you and I formed a blood bond as children, something that goes even beyond the typical familiar connection. That bond is beginning to reassert itself now that the spell blocking our memories has lifted."

A blood bond. Between us. Formed when I was—what, five? Seven? I had no memory of it, no recollection of ever meeting Raechelle before last night, but I couldn't deny that I felt *something* when I looked at her. A pull, an attraction, a sense of rightness that defied rational explanation.

"What does that mean?" I asked. "Practically speaking?"

"It means we're connected on a fundamental level," she explained. "Eventually, as the bond strengthens, we'll be able to sense each other's emotions, share strength, potentially even thoughts if the connection grows deep enough. It means that my magic and yours will work in perfect harmony, that we'll fight as one, think as one in critical moments."

"And the romantic aspect?" I asked, remembering my mother's pointed references to Mary Jane and Gamora and other fictional love interests. "She seemed pretty clear that this bond is meant to be..."

"Romantic. Sexual. Yes." Raechelle met my gaze steadily, not flinching from the topic. "Blood bonds almost always develop into romantic relationships, Riven. The intimacy of the connection, the depth of understanding—it naturally leads to love. But," she added quickly, "that doesn't mean you're obligated to anything. The bond influences, it doesn't control. Your choices are your own."

I sat with that for a moment, processing the implications. I was attracted to Raechelle—I'd be lying if I denied it. She was beautiful, intelligent, clearly powerful in her own right. But was that genuine attraction, or was it the bond influencing my feelings? And did it matter? If the bond was part of who I was now, part of my heritage and destiny, did trying to separate my "real" feelings from the magical ones even make sense?

"I don't know how to do this," I admitted. "Any of this. The magic, the vampire thing, the bond, all of it. I feel like I'm drowning, and every time I think I'm getting my head above water, another wave hits."

"Then stop trying to do it all at once." Raechelle reached over and took my hand, her cool fingers interlacing with my warmer ones. The contact sent a pleasant shiver up my arm. "You don't have to master everything tonight, Riven. You don't have to understand your full abilities or accept every aspect of your new reality right this moment. All you have to do is survive until tomorrow, and then the next day, and the next. One step at a time."

"And you'll help me?" I asked, hating how vulnerable I sounded but unable to keep the need from my voice. "You'll teach me? Stay with me?"

"Always." She said it like a vow, like a promise carved into her very bones. "I'm your familiar, Riven. Your companion, your protector, your partner. I will never leave your side unless you order me to, and even then, I'd probably find a way to disobey." The last bit was said with a slight smile, taking the edge off the intensity.

Some of the tension in my chest eased. I wasn't alone. Despite everything I'd lost, despite the impossible situation I'd been thrust into, I wasn't alone. Raechelle was here, and she would help me navigate this new existence. It didn't fix everything—didn't bring my parents back, didn't erase the grief or the fear or the overwhelming sense of being lost—but it was something. An anchor. A lifeline.

"Okay," I said, squeezing her hand. "Okay. So what's next? What do I need to learn first?"

"Control," she answered immediately. "Right now, your senses are in chaos, and your magic is barely contained. Before we can do anything else—before we can safely leave this property or interact with other supernaturals—you need to learn basic control. How to filter sensory input, how to keep your power from leaking everywhere, how to appear human when necessary."

"How long will that take?"

"For basic control? A few days of focused practice. For true mastery?" She shrugged eloquently. "Decades, potentially. But we're not aiming for mastery right now. We're aiming for survival."

Survival. Such a simple word for such a complex goal. But she was right—that had to be the priority. Stay alive, learn control, understand what I was becoming, and *then* worry about the bigger questions like what my role as Blood Archon actually entailed or how I would eventually face Terravos.

"All right," I said, straightening up despite the lingering exhaustion in my limbs. "Then let's start. What do I need to do?"

Raechelle's smile widened, pride evident in her crimson gaze. "First, we're going to work on your sensory control. Right now, you're experiencing everything at maximum intensity, which is exhausting and unsustainable. I'm going to teach you how to mentally 'dial down' the volume on senses you're not actively using."

For the next hour, Raechelle walked me through a series of meditation exercises designed to help me consciously control my awareness. It was harder than it sounded—trying to hear less, smell less, see less when my body desperately wanted to process every piece of input it received. But gradually, painstakingly, I began to get the hang of it.

I learned that I could focus my enhanced hearing on specific sounds while letting others fade to white noise. I discovered that my sense of smell could be temporarily muted, though not eliminated entirely. I found that I could adjust my night vision, dimming the supernatural clarity to something closer to normal human sight when necessary.

"Good," Raechelle murmured after I successfully managed to maintain the dampened state for a full five minutes. "That's very good, Riven. Most newly turned vampires take several days to achieve what you just did."

"Is that the Blood Archon thing?" I asked, letting my senses gradually return to their enhanced state. "Am I learning faster because of the magic?"

"Possibly. Or it could simply be natural aptitude. Your mother always said you were a quick study."

The mention of my mother sent a pang through my chest, but it was bearable now, dulled by exhaustion and the strange sense of purpose the training had given me. I'd grieve—I *would* grieve, properly and fully, for the parents who had loved me and protected me and ultimately died for me. But right now, I had to survive. I had to become strong enough to survive. That was what they would have wanted.

"What else?" I asked. "What other control do I need?"

"Your magic," she said, her expression growing serious. "Right now, you're radiating power like a beacon. Any supernatural creature within miles can sense you, which makes you incredibly vulnerable to attack. The ring your father made helps mask your signature, but you need to learn conscious control as well."

I glanced down at the black band on my middle finger, the ring that had resized itself to fit me perfectly when I'd first put it on. According to my mother's letter, it would hide my abilities from those who might hunt me, but apparently, it wasn't foolproof.

"How do I do that?" I asked. "Control the magic, I mean?"

"It's similar to the sensory control," Raechelle explained. "Your magic is part of you, like a limb or an organ. Right now, it's uncontrolled, constantly active and visible. You need to learn to pull it inward, to contain it within yourself rather than letting it radiate outward."

She guided me through another series of exercises, these ones focused on visualization and internal awareness. I had to imagine my magic as a tangible thing—for some reason, my mind kept conjuring the image of liquid crimson light—and then visualize drawing it inward, compressing it, containing it within the core of my being.

It was frustrating work. Every time I thought I had it, that I'd managed to pull the power fully inside, Raechelle would shake her head and tell me there was still leakage. But I persisted, driven by the knowledge that my survival might depend on this skill, and slowly, slowly, I began to improve.

"There," Raechelle said finally, satisfaction evident in her voice. "You've got it. Your signature is almost completely masked now."

I released a breath I hadn't realized I was holding, feeling oddly bereft without the constant hum of magic radiating from my skin. It was still there—I could feel it churning inside me, powerful and vast—but now it was contained, hidden, mine alone.

"This is exhausting," I said, slumping back against the sofa. "Is it always going to be this much work?"

"Not once it becomes second nature," she assured me. "Right now, you're having to consciously control everything because these abilities are new. Give it a few weeks, and you won't even have to think about it. The control will be automatic."

A few weeks. That seemed like an eternity when every moment felt like I was barely holding myself together. But I'd survived this long. I could survive a few weeks more.

"Riven," Raechelle said softly, and something in her tone made me look up. "There's one more thing we need to discuss. About your parents."

My stomach clenched. "What about them?"

She chose her words carefully, as if walking through a minefield. "They weren't just ordinary people who happened to have a magical bloodline. Your mother, Elara, was one of the most skilled blood mages of her generation. Your father, Marcus, was a master artificer—one of the few humans who could craft magical objects without possessing magic himself. Together, they were formidable."

"Then why didn't they fight?" The words burst out of me, edged with the anger and grief I'd been suppressing. "If they were so powerful, why did they just let Terravos kill them?"

"Because they were protecting you," Raechelle said gently. "If they had fought back, had used their full power against Terravos, the battle would have destroyed everything for miles around. Including you. They chose to die so that you could live, Riven. They chose to buy you time to awaken, to learn, to become strong enough to face the threats that are coming."

The grief surged up again, overwhelming in its intensity, and this time I couldn't hold it back. A sob tore from my throat, and then another, and suddenly I was crying in earnest—great, heaving sobs that shook my entire frame. All the horror of the past day, all the loss and fear and confusion, came pouring out in a flood of tears I couldn't control.

Raechelle didn't say anything. She simply pulled me against her, wrapping her arms around me and holding me as I fell apart. I buried my face in her shoulder, clutching at her shirt like a lifeline, and wept for the parents I'd never see again, for the normal life I'd never get back, for the innocence I'd lost in the span of a single terrible night.

She stroked my hair, murmuring soft words in a language I didn't recognize, and through the bond—that strange, developing connection between us—I could feel her own grief mixing with mine. She had loved them too, I realized. My parents had been more than just her masters; they'd been friends, companions, people she'd known for years and would now never see again.

We stayed like that for a long time, two grief-stricken people holding each other in the darkness, finding comfort in shared sorrow. Eventually, my sobs subsided, reducing to occasional hiccups and shuddering breaths. I felt hollowed out, exhausted on a level that went beyond mere physical tiredness.

"I'm sorry," I mumbled against her shoulder, my voice rough from crying.

"Don't be." She pulled back just enough to cup my face in her hands, forcing me to meet her gaze. Her crimson eyes shimmered with unshed tears. "Grief is nothing to apologize for, Riven. Your parents deserve your tears. They deserve to be mourned. Don't ever feel ashamed of that."

I nodded, not trusting myself to speak. Her thumbs wiped away the moisture on my cheeks with gentle precision, and I became aware once again of how close we were, how intimate this moment felt. The bond hummed between us, stronger than it had been before, as if our shared grief had somehow deepened the connection.

"You should rest," Raechelle said softly, though she made no move to pull away. "It's nearly dawn, and your body needs more time to adjust to the transformation. Proper sleep will help."

"Will you stay?" I asked, hating how needy I sounded but unable to stop myself. "I don't—I don't want to be alone right now."

"Of course." She shifted, rearranging us on the sofa so that we were lying down, my head pillowed on her shoulder and her arms wrapped securely around me. "I'll be right here, Riven. I promise. Sleep now."

The position should have felt awkward—we barely knew each other, after all, regardless of what magical bonds might exist between us—but instead it felt perfect. Natural. Like this was exactly where I was supposed to be. Her presence was calming, grounding me in the moment and keeping the worst of the fear and grief at bay.

"Raechelle?" I mumbled, already feeling sleep pulling at me.

"Mmm?"

"Thank you. For everything. For helping me, for teaching me, for... for being here."

I felt her press a gentle kiss to the top of my head, the gesture achingly tender. "Always, Riven. I will always be here."

Those words followed me down into sleep, a promise and a comfort and a hope for the impossible future stretching out before me. Tomorrow would bring new challenges, new lessons, new grief to process and powers to master. But tonight, I was safe. I was not alone. And for now, that was enough.
